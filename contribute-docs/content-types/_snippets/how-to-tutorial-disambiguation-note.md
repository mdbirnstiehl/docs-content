Tutorials differ from how-to guides in scope and purpose:

- **[How-to guides](/contribute-docs/content-types/how-tos.md)** are focused recipes for a single, discrete task with minimal explanation.
- **[Tutorials](/contribute-docs/content-types/tutorials.md)** chain multiple how-to guides together with explanatory context and often detailed code annotations.

If your content has a broader learning objective beyond completing a single task, use a tutorial.
