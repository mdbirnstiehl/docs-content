# Google Sheets to CSV Configuration
#
# This file defines which Google Sheet to sync and how to transform the data.
#
# Two formats are supported:
#
# 1. Legacy (single output) - uses top-level 'columns' and 'output' keys.
#    This is the current format used below.
#
# 2. Multi-output - uses top-level 'outputs' key with a list of output
#    entries. Each entry can have its own columns, filter, sort, filename,
#    and directory. An optional 'defaults' key provides shared values.
#    See the commented-out example at the bottom of this file.

# Google Sheet source
source:
  # Google Sheets URL or spreadsheet ID
  # SECURITY: For public repos, use environment variable substitution
  # to avoid exposing the sheet URL
  #
  # Option 1: Environment variable (recommended for public repos)
  # Set GOOGLE_SHEET_URL as a GitHub Secret
  # sheet_url: "${GOOGLE_SHEET_URL}"
  #
  # Option 2: Direct value (for testing/private repos)
  sheet_url: "${GOOGLE_SHEET_URL}"

  # Name of the tab/sheet within the spreadsheet
  # Can also use environment variable if needed
  tab_name: "Public Model List"

# Column configuration
# Define which columns to include in the CSV and optionally rename them
# columns:
#  - source: "Author"
#  - source: "Name"
#  - source: "ID"
#  - source: "Model Card"
#  - source: "Provider Terms"
#  - source: "Input Modalities"
#  - source: "Output Modalities"
#  - source: "EOL Date"
#  - source: "Data Retention Period (Days)"
#  - source: "Data Used To Train Models?"
#  - source: "Inference Regions"
#  - source: "Release Status"
#  - source: "Stack Version"

# Output configuration
#output:
  # Output CSV filename
#  filename: "models.csv"

  # Output directory (relative to repo root)
#  directory: "explore-analyze/elastic-inference"

  # CSV delimiter (default: comma)
#  delimiter: ","


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multi-output format example (commented out)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To switch to multi-output mode, remove the 'columns' and 'output' keys
# above and uncomment the 'defaults' and 'outputs' sections below.
#
defaults:
#   # Shared settings inherited by all outputs (can be overridden per output)
 directory: "explore-analyze/elastic-inference"
 delimiter: ","
 columns:
     - source: "Author"
     - source: "Name"
     - source: "ID"
     - source: "Model Card"
     - source: "Provider Terms"
     - source: "Input Modalities"
     - source: "Output Modalities"
     - source: "EOL Date"
     - source: "Data Retention Period (Days)"
     - source: "Data Used To Train Models?"
     - source: "Inference Regions"
     - source: "Release Status"
     - source: "Stack Version"
#
outputs:
   # Each entry generates one CSV file.
#
   - filename: "chat-models.csv"
#     # Inherits columns, directory, delimiter from defaults
     filter:
       column: "Type"
       values: ["LLM Chat"]
     sort:
       by: "Name"
       direction: "ascending"
#
   - filename: "embedding-models.csv"
#     # Group multiple Type values into one output
     filter:
       column: "Type"
       values: ["Embedding - Sparse", "Embedding - Dense"]
     sort:
       by: "Name"
       direction: "ascending"
#
   - filename: "reranker-models.csv"
     filter:
       column: "Type"
       values: ["Reranker"]
     sort:
       by: "Name"
       direction: "ascending"
#
#   - filename: "all-models.csv"
#     # No filter: includes all rows
#     sort:
#       by: "Name"
#       direction: "ascending"
