# Change the interface language in {{kib}}

{{kib}} can display its interface in several languages. From the application header, you can select the language you prefer for your current project or deployment.

:::{tip}
If you're using {{ecloud}}, this setting only applies to the {{kib}} UI of your serverless projects and hosted deployments.
:::

## Change your interface language

1. Open the user menu from the header.
2. Select **Language**.

   :::{note}
   :applies_to: { self: , ece: , eck: }
   On self-managed, {{ece}}, and {{eck}} deployments of {{kib}}, this option is located on your profile page. To access it, select **Edit profile** from the header's user menu, then find the **Language** section.
   :::

3. Select your preferred language from the **Display language** menu.
4. Select **Save changes**.
5. Refresh the page to apply the selected language.

## If your language isn't available

By default, {{kib}} offers localized versions for [some languages](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/internationalization-settings.md#built-in-and-custom-locales).

On {{ech}}, {{ece}}, {{eck}}, and self-managed deployments, administrators can enable or disable languages, or turn language selection off, in the [internationalization settings](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/internationalization-settings.md).
