# {{es}} solution overview

The {{es}} solution and serverless project type provide specialized UI tools that help you build search-powered applications faster. These tools build on top of core {{es}} [search capabilities](/solutions/search.md) that are available across all deployment types, solutions, and project types.

These UI affordances are exclusive to the {{es}} solution and serverless project type.

::::{tip}
Not sure which deployment type is right for you? Use the following resources to help you decide:

- Read the Elastic [deployment types overview](/deploy-manage/deploy.md)
- Compare [serverless and {{ech}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/deployment-comparison.md)
  - Compare pricing models between [{{ech}}](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/cloud-hosted-deployment-billing-dimensions.md) and [Serverless](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/serverless-project-billing-dimensions.md)

## Features and tools

The {{es}} solution provides the following specialized UI tools and features to help you build search-powered applications faster:

### Agent Builder

[Agent Builder](/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder.md) enables you to create AI agents that can interact with your {{es}} data, run queries, and provide intelligent responses. It provides a complete framework for building conversational AI experiences on top of your search infrastructure.

### Playground

[Playground](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project/playground.md) lets you use large language models (LLMs) to understand, explore, and analyze your {{es}} data using retrieval augmented generation (RAG), via a chat interface. Playground is also useful for testing and debugging your {{es}} queries using the [retrievers](/solutions/search/retrievers-overview.md) syntax.

### Synonyms UI

The [synonyms UI](/solutions/search/full-text/search-with-synonyms.md#method-1-kib-ui) enables managing synonym sets directly within {{kib}}. This makes it easier to improve search relevance without editing configuration files.

### Query Rules UI

The [Query Rules UI](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project/query-rules-ui.md) enables you to create and manage query rules that modify search behavior based on specific conditions, helping you deliver more relevant results for common queries.
