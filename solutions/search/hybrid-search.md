# Hybrid search

Hybrid search runs [full-text search](full-text.md) and [vector search](vector.md) in one request. For the vector part, you can use managed [semantic search](semantic-search.md) workflows or set up vector fields yourself. Either way, you return one ranked list that combines keyword matching with similarity search.

On {{serverless-full}}, it's recommended to use an [{{es}} {{vectordb}} project](/solutions/vector-database.md). New users can [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration?onboarding_token=vector). For other deployment types, refer to [Quick start options](/get-started/deployment-options.md#quick-start-options).

The recommended way to use hybrid search in the {{stack}} is the [`semantic_text` workflow](semantic-search/semantic-search-semantic-text.md). Check out the [hands-on tutorial](hybrid-semantic-text.md) for a step-by-step guide.

For examples of using approximate kNN in hybrid search, refer to [Use approximate kNN in hybrid search](vector/knn/approximate-knn-query-examples.md#combine_approximate_knn_with_other_features).

We recommend implementing hybrid search with the [reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/reciprocal-rank-fusion.md) algorithm. This approach merges rankings from the full-text and vector queries, giving more weight to documents that score well in either one. The final list balances exact keyword matches with similarity-based matches.
