# Dense vector search in {{es}}

Dense vectors use neural embeddings to represent semantic meaning. They translate text, images, or other data into fixed-length vectors of floating-point numbers. Content with similar meaning is mapped to nearby points in vector space, making dense vector search a powerful technique for:

- Finding semantically similar content
- Matching natural language questions with relevant answers
- Performing image and multimedia similarity search
- Delivering content-based recommendations

If you're using {{serverless-full}}, [compare {{es}} and Vector Database projects](/solutions/vector-database.md#when-to-use-this-project-type) before implementing dense vector search.

## Working with dense vectors in {{es}}

:::{tip}
For most use cases, the [`semantic_text` field type](../semantic-search/semantic-search-semantic-text.md) is the recommended starting point. It provides automatic model management and sensible defaults for vector search.
:::

To implement dense vector search in {{es}}, you need both an index configuration and a way to generate embeddings:

1. **Index documents with embeddings**
   - Generate embeddings directly in {{es}}
     - Refer to the [overview of NLP model options](../semantic-search.md#using-nlp-models)
   - Or [bring your own embeddings](bring-own-vectors.md)
     - Store them using the `dense_vector` field type
   - {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3, ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable` Optionally [accelerate HNSW indexing with a GPU](gpu-vector-indexing.md)

2. **Query the index with k-NN search**
   - Use the [`knn` query](knn.md) to retrieve results based on vector similarity

## Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) [bbq]

Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) is an advanced vector quantization technique for `dense_vector` fields. It compresses embeddings into compact binary form, enabling faster similarity search and reducing memory usage. This improves both search relevance and cost efficiency, especially when used with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World).

New indices with `float` or `bfloat16` vectors and 384 or more dimensions will default to BBQ HNSW automatically for optimal performance and memory efficiency. Other element types, such as `byte` and `bit`, default to plain `hnsw` with no quantization.

Learn more about how BBQ works, supported algorithms, and configuration examples in the [Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/bbq).

::::{tip}
When using the [`semantic_text` field type](../semantic-search/semantic-search-semantic-text.md), you can configure BBQ and other quantization options through the `index_options` parameter. Refer to [Optimizing vector storage with `index_options`](vector-storage-for-semantic-search.md) for examples of using `bbq_hnsw`, `int8_hnsw`, and other quantization strategies with semantic text fields.
