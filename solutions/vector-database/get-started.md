# Get started with the {{es}} {{vectordb}} project type

The {{es}} {{vectordb}} project type on {{serverless-full}} is built for AI-powered vector retrieval. Use this guide to create a project and learn about the different methods to ingest embeddings and run search queries.

To try a hands-on tutorial where you connect a client, index sample data, and run semantic, hybrid, and ES|QL searches, refer to [](/solutions/vector-database/vector-full-text-search.md).

:::{note}
Not sure whether this project type is right for you? Refer to [When to use this project type](/solutions/vector-database.md#when-to-use-this-project-type).

If you're looking for an introduction to the {{stack}} or the {{es}} product, refer to [](/get-started/index.md) or [](/manage-data/data-store.md).

::::::{stepper}
:::::{step} Create an {{es}} {{vectordb}} {{serverless-short}} project

There are two options to create serverless projects:

* If you're a new user, [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration?onboarding_token=vector). For more information about {{ecloud}} trials, refer to [Trial information](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/create-an-organization.md#general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial).
* If you're an existing customer, [log in to {{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/login) and do the following:
  1. Select **Create project** from the **Serverless projects** panel.
  2. Select **Next** from the **{{vectordb}}** panel.
  3. Name your project.
  4. Select a cloud provider and region. For available regions, refer to [Regions](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/regions.md).
  5. Select **Create project**. It takes a few minutes to create your project.
  6. When the project is ready, select **Continue** to open it (you might need to log in to {{ecloud}} again).

:::{note}
You need the `admin` predefined role or an equivalent custom role to create projects. For more information, refer to [User roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md).
:::

After you've created your project, note the {{es}} endpoint and API key from the project connection details. You'll use these to index data and run searches. New indices in this project type use [vector index mode](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/dense-vector.md#dense-vector-vectordb-document-mode) automatically.
:::::

:::::{step} (Optional) Follow the in-product setup guides

When you create a new {{vectordb}} project, the **Set up your {{es}} {{vectordb}}** page includes two guided paths you can follow. Each path walks you through ingest and then search examples, with sample scripts you can run in a client of your choosing or run the examples directly in the Dev Tools Console.

The following setup guides are available in {{kib}}:

| Guide | When to use | What you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate embeddings from your content | You want {{es}} to create embeddings for you | Ingest content into a `semantic_text` field, then run a semantic or hybrid query |
| Store your existing embeddings | You already have vectors from your own model | Index pre-generated embeddings into a `dense_vector` field, then run a semantic or hybrid query |

Alternatively, you can also use the [](/solutions/vector-database/vector-full-text-search.md) quickstart to connect a client, index sample data, and run semantic, hybrid, and ES|QL searches.

You can also skip the setup guide and continue with the following steps.
:::::

:::::{step} Ingest your data
Use the approach that matches how you create embeddings.

::::{dropdown} Generate embeddings from your content
You can generate embeddings as part of the ingestion workflow instead of creating them in advance. Choose the field type that matches your content:

* **Text-only content:** Map the target field as [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md). When you ingest documents, {{es}} uses the configured {{infer}} endpoint to generate and store embeddings automatically.
  To walk through this workflow, follow [](/solutions/vector-database/vector-full-text-search.md).
* **Multimodal content:** Map the target field as [`semantic`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-field.md). Use this field type when you need to search across text, images, or other media with a multimodal model.
  To walk through this workflow, follow [Tutorial: Build multimodal search with a `semantic` field](/solutions/search/multimodal-search/multimodal-search-tutorial.md).

:::{tip}
You can include metadata fields in the same [mapping](/manage-data/data-store/mapping.md) as your embeddings, then filter on them when you search.
:::

::::

::::{dropdown} Store your existing embeddings
Create an index with a [`dense_vector`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/dense-vector.md) field, and any other text or metadata fields you might need, then index your pre-generated vectors.

To walk through indexing sample embeddings and running a kNN search, follow [Bring your own dense vectors to {{es}}](/solutions/search/vector/bring-own-vectors.md).
::::

:::::

:::::{step} Search your data
The search query type you can use depends on the vector field type you want to search. For an overview of field types and the queries you can use with each, refer to [Vector field types and queries](/solutions/search/vector.md#vector-queries-and-field-types). You can also combine vector queries with [filters](/solutions/search/vector/knn.md#knn-search-filter-example) on metadata fields in the same request.

## Next steps

After you've learned how to ingest embeddings and return relevant results, dig deeper into how vector search works, improve ranking for your use case, and tune project settings for latency and cost. Review the following: 

* [Vector search in {{es}}](/solutions/search/vector.md): Concepts, field types, quantization, and query options
* [Ranking and reranking](/solutions/search/ranking.md): Improve relevance after you have a baseline
* [RAG](/solutions/search/rag.md): Patterns for grounding LLMs on retrieved context
* [Vector search use cases](/solutions/search/vector/vector-search-use-cases.md): RAG, recommendations, multimodal search, and more
* [Search Power](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md#elasticsearch-manage-project-search-power-settings) and [billing dimensions](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/vector-database-billing-dimensions.md): Balance latency and cost for your project
* [{{es}} {{vectordb}} overview](/solutions/vector-database.md): When to choose this project type versus the general-purpose {{es}} project
