# Real User Monitoring (RUM) [apm-rum]

Real User Monitoring captures user interaction with clients such as web browsers. The [JavaScript Agent](apm-agent-rum-js://reference/index.md) is Elastic’s RUM Agent.

Unlike Elastic APM backend agents which monitor requests and responses, the RUM JavaScript agent monitors the real user experience and interaction within your client-side application. The RUM JavaScript agent is also framework-agnostic, which means it can be used with any front-end JavaScript application.

You will be able to measure metrics such as "Time to First Byte", `domInteractive`, and `domComplete` which helps you discover performance issues within your client-side application as well as issues that relate to the latency of your server-side application.
