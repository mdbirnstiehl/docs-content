# Custom links in the Applications UI [apm-custom-links]

::::{note}

**For serverless Observability projects**, the **Editor** role or higher is required to create and manage custom links. To learn more, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md#general-assign-user-roles).

::::

Elastic’s custom link feature allows you to easily create up to 500 dynamic links based on your specific APM data. Custom links can be filtered to only appear in the Applications UI for relevant services, environments, transaction types, or transaction names.

Ready to dive in? Jump straight to the [examples](#custom-links-examples).

## Create a link [custom-links-create]

Each custom link consists of a label, URL, and optional filter. The easiest way to create a custom link is from within the actions dropdown in the transaction detail page. This method will automatically apply filters, scoping the link to that specific service, environment, transaction type, and transaction name.

Alternatively, you can create a custom link in the Applications UI by navigating to **Settings** > **Customize UI**, and selecting **Create custom link**.

### Label [custom-links-label]

The name of your custom link. The actions context menu displays this text, so keep it as short as possible.

::::{tip}
Custom links are displayed alphabetically in the actions menu.
::::

### URL [custom-links-url]

The URL your link points to. URLs support dynamic field name variables, encapsulated in double curly brackets: `{{field.name}}`. These variables will be replaced with transaction metadata when the link is clicked.

Because everyone’s data is different, you’ll need to examine your traces to see what metadata is available for use. To do this, select a trace in the Applications UI, and click **Metadata** in the **Trace Sample** table.

### Filters [custom-links-filters]

Filter each link to only appear for specific services or transactions. You can filter on the following fields:

* `service.name`
* `service.env`
* `transaction.type`
* `transaction.name`

Multiple values are allowed when comma-separated.

## Custom link examples [custom-links-examples]

Not sure where to start with custom links? Take a look at the examples below and customize them to your liking!

### Email [custom-links-examples-email]
