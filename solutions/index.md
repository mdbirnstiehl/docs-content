# Solutions and use cases

:::{tip}
New to Elastic? Refer to [Elastic Fundamentals](/get-started/index.md) to understand the {{stack}}, its components, and your deployment options.
:::

Elastic helps you build applications for three main use cases: search, observability, and security. You can work directly with platform capabilities through APIs, use pre-built solutions with integrated UIs, or combine both approaches.

## Choose your path

Use the following table to choose a solution or project type when you need solution UIs or a dedicated {{serverless-full}} project type. Core {{es}} search features that apply across deployment types are covered in [](/solutions/search.md).

| Your use case | What to use | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Building search-powered applications | 1. [Elasticsearch solution](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project.md)<br><br> 2. [{{es}} {{vectordb}}](/solutions/vector-database.md) {applies_to}`stack: unavailable` | 1. Additional UI tools that complement the core search features<br><br>2. Dedicated {{serverless-full}} project type for AI-powered retrieval (RAG, recommendations, semantic and hybrid search) with vector-tuned defaults |
| Monitoring applications or infrastructure | [Observability solution](/solutions/observability.md) | Monitor and troubleshoot with logs, metrics, and traces |
| Protecting against threats | [Security solution](/solutions/security.md) | Detect and respond to security threats |

::::{tip}
Not sure which to choose? Start with the {{es}} solution for general-purpose search and analytics if you don't need the additional features of {{product.observability}}, {{product.security}}, or the preconfigured defaults of {{es}} {{vectordb}}.

## About solutions and project types

- On {{serverless-full}}, select a solution as your project type when creating a project.
- On {{ech}}, ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters, select a default solution view when creating a deployment, or configure per [space](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md).
