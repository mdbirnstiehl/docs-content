# Entity analytics overview

The **Entity analytics** page provides a centralized view of emerging insider threats—including host risk, user risk, service risk, and anomalies from within your network. Use it to triage, investigate, and respond to these emerging threats.

To access the page, find **Entity analytics** → **Overview** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

:::{admonition} Requirements
* This feature requires the appropriate [subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) in {{stack}} or [project feature tier](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md) in {{serverless-short}}.

* To get access to this page, turn on the `securitySolution:enablePrivilegedUserMonitoring` [advanced setting](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#access-privileged-user-monitoring).
:::


The  **Entity analytics** page includes the following sections:

* [Entity KPIs (key performance indicators)](#entity-kpis)
* [User Risk Scores](#entity-user-risk-scores)
* [Host Risk Scores](#entity-host-risk-scores)
* [Service Risk Scores](#service-risk-scores)
* [Entities](#entity-entities)
* [Anomalies](#entity-anomalies)


## Entity KPIs (key performance indicators) [entity-kpis]

This section displays the total number of critical hosts, critical users, and anomalies. Select a link to jump to the **Hosts** page, **Users** page, or **Anomalies** table.


## User Risk Scores [entity-user-risk-scores]

:::{admonition} Requirements
To display user risk scores, you must [turn on the risk scoring engine](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/turn-on-risk-scoring-engine.md).
:::


This section displays user risk score data for your environment, including the total number of users, and the five most recently recorded user risk scores, with their associated user names, risk data, and number of detection alerts. User risk scores are [calculated](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-risk-scoring.md#how-is-risk-score-calculated) using a weighted sum on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).

## Service Risk Scores

:::{admonition} Requirements
To display service risk scores, you must [turn on the risk scoring engine](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/turn-on-risk-scoring-engine.md).
:::

This section displays service risk score data for your environment, including the total number of services, and the five most recently recorded service risk scores, with their associated service names, risk data, and number of detection alerts. Service risk scores are [calculated](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-risk-scoring.md#how-is-risk-score-calculated) using a weighted sum on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-service-risk-scores.png

Interact with the table to filter data, view more details, and take action:

* Select the **Service risk level** menu to filter the chart by the selected level.
* Click a service name link to open the service details flyout.
* Hover over a service name link to display inline actions: **Add to timeline** ({icon}`timeline`) and **Copy to Clipboard** ({icon}`copy_clipboard`).
* Click the number link in the **Alerts** column to view the alerts on the **Alerts** page. Hover over the number and select **Investigate in timeline** ({icon}`timeline`) to launch Timeline with a query that includes the associated service name value.

For more information about service risk scores, refer to [](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-risk-scoring.md).


## Entities [entity-entities]


:::{admonition} Requirements
To display the **Entities** section, you must [enable the entity store](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-store.md#enable-entity-store).
:::


This section provides a centralized view of all hosts, users, and services in your environment. It displays entities from the [entity store](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-store.md), which meet any of the following criteria:

* Have been observed by {{elastic-sec}}
* Have an asset criticality assignment
* Have been added to {{elastic-sec}} through an integration, such Active Directory or Okta

:::{note}
The **Entities** table only shows a subset of the data available for each entity. You can query the `.entities.v1.latest.security_user_<space-id>`, `.entities.v1.latest.security_host_<space-id>`, and `.entities.v1.latest.security_service_<space-id>` indices to see all the fields for each entity in the entity store.
:::


:::{image} /solutions/images/security-entities-section.png
:alt: Entities section
:screenshot:
:::

Entity data from different sources appears in the **Entities** section based on the following timelines:

* When you first enable the entity store, only data stored in the last 24 hours is processed. After that, data is processed continuously.
* Observed events from the {{elastic-sec}} default data view are processed in near real-time.
* Entity Analytics data, such as entity risk scores and asset criticality (including bulk asset criticality upload), is also processed in near real-time.
* The availability of entities extracted from Entity Analytics integrations depends on the specific integration. Refer to [Active Directory Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_ad), [Microsoft Entra ID Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_entra_id), and [Okta Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_okta) for more details.

Interact with the table to filter data and view more details:

* Select the **Risk level** dropdown to filter the table by the selected user, host, or service risk level.
* Select the **Criticality** dropdown to filter the table by the selected asset criticality level.
* Select the **Source** dropdown to filter the table by the data source.
* Click the **View details** icon ({icon}`expand` ) to open the entity details flyout.



## Anomalies [entity-anomalies]

Anomaly detection jobs identify suspicious or irregular behavior patterns. The **Anomalies** table displays the total number of anomalies identified by these prebuilt {{ml}} jobs (named in the **Anomaly name** column).

:::{admonition} Requirements
To display anomaly results, you must [install and run](/explore-analyze/machine-learning/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-run-jobs.md) one or more [prebuilt anomaly detection jobs](/reference/data-analysis/machine-learning/ootb-ml-jobs-siem.md). You cannot add custom anomaly detection jobs to the **Entity analytics** page.
:::


:::{image} /solutions/images/security-anomalies-table.png
:alt: Anomalies table
:screenshot:
:::

Interact with the table to view more details:

* Click **View all host anomalies** to go to the **Anomalies** table on the **Hosts** page.
* Click **View all user anomalies** to go to the **Anomalies** table on the **Users** page.
* Click **View all** to display and manage all machine learning jobs on the **Anomaly Detection Jobs** page.
