# MITRE ATT&CK coverage [security-rules-coverage]

The **MITRE ATT&CK coverage** page shows which [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) adversary tactics and techniques are covered by your installed and enabled detection rules, including both Elastic prebuilt rules and custom rules.

How you use this page depends on your goal:

- **Identifying coverage gaps**: Filter to view only enabled rules, then look for light or empty cells to find tactics and techniques where your detection coverage is thin. Use this to prioritize which [prebuilt rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/install-prebuilt-rules.md) to install or which [custom rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-rule-ui.md) to build next.
- **Activating coverage quickly**: Find techniques you care about and [enable installed rules](#security-rules-coverage-enable-rules) directly from the coverage grid, without leaving the page.

## Access the page [access-mitre-page]

Find **MITRE ATT&CK coverage** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

## Read the coverage grid [read-coverage-grid]

Mirroring the MITRE ATT&CK framework, columns represent major tactics, and cells within each column represent a tactic's related techniques. Cells are darker when a technique has more rules matching the current filters, as indicated in the **Legend** at the top.

::::{note}
The coverage grid only includes detection rules you currently have installed, and only rules that are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK. Prebuilt rules that are not installed, and custom rules that are unmapped or mapped to a deprecated tactic or technique, do not appear. You can map custom rules to tactics in **Advanced settings** when creating or editing a rule.

## Supported MITRE ATT&CK versions [supported-versions]

The coverage page maps detections to [MITRE ATT&CK versions](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/) used by {{elastic-sec}}.

| {{elastic-sec}} version | MITRE ATT\&CK version |
| :---- | :---- |
| 9.0.0 | [v15.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2024/) |
| 9.0.1-9.0.6 | [v16.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2024/) |
| 9.0.7-9.0.8 | [v17.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2025/) |
| 9.1.0-9.1.3 | [v16.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2024/) |
| 9.1.4-9.1.9 | [v17.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2025/) |
| 9.1.10 | [v18.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2025/) |
| 9.2.0-9.2.3 | [v17.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2025/) |
| 9.2.4-9.4.3 | [v18.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2025/) |
| 9.5.0+ | [v19.1](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2026/) |

::::{note}
:applies_to: {stack: ga 9.5, serverless: ga}
MITRE ATT\&CK v19 retires the Defense Evasion tactic and replaces it with Stealth and Defense Impairment. If you have custom rules mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK, check [](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/remap-mitre-attack.md) to find and update mappings that changed in v19.

## Filter rules [security-rules-coverage-filter-rules]

Use the drop-down filters at the top of the page to control which of your installed detection rules are included in calculating coverage.

* **Installed rule status**: Select to include **Enabled rules**, **Not enabled rules**, or both.
* **Installed rule type**: Select to include **Elastic rules** (prebuilt rules), **Custom rules** (user-created rules), or both.

You can also search for a tactic or technique name, technique number, or rule name in the search bar. The search bar acts as a filter for the coverage grid: only rules matching the search term are included.

::::{note}
Searches for tactics and techniques must match exactly, are case sensitive, and do *not* support wildcards.
::::


## Expand and collapse cells [security-rules-coverage-expand-and-collapse-cells]

Select **Collapse cells** or **Expand cells** to change how much information the cells display. Cells always include the technique's name and the number of sub-techniques covered by enabled rules. Expand the cells to also display counts of not-enabled and enabled rules for each technique.

::::{note}
The counts inside cells are affected by how you filter the page. For example, if you filter the **Installed rule status** to only include **Enabled rules**, then all not-enabled rule counts are 0 because those rules are filtered out.
::::



## Enable rules [security-rules-coverage-enable-rules]

You can quickly enable all the rules for a specific technique that you've installed but not yet enabled. Select the technique's cell, then select **Enable all disabled** in the popup that appears.


## Learn more about techniques and sub-techniques [security-rules-coverage-learn-more-about-techniques-and-sub-techniques]

For more information on a specific technique and its sub-techniques, select the technique's cell, then select the title in the popup that appears. This opens a new browser tab with the technique's MITRE ATT&CK documentation.
