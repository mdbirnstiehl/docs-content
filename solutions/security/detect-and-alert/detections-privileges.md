# Detections privileges [security-detections-requirements-custom-role-privileges]

Learn about the access requirements for detection features, including:

- **Privilege requirements**: Cluster, index, and {{kib}} privileges that your role needs to enable detections, manage rules, view and edit alerts, and more
- **Predefined {{serverless-full}} roles**: {{serverless-short}} roles with detection privileges
- **Authorization model**: How rules inherit privileges from their last editor using API keys

For instructions on turning on the detections feature, refer to [Turn on detections](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/turn-on-detections.md).

:::{important}
Rules run in the background using the privileges of the user who last edited them. Ensure that only users with the appropriate access edit them. Refer to [](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detection-rule-concepts.md#rule-authorization-concept) for more details.

## About index privileges

When creating custom roles for detection features, you'll need to grant access to system indices that include your space ID (`<space-id>`). For example, the default space uses `.alerts-security.alerts-default`. Refer to the following details to understand which system indices your role might require access to.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` You can give a role access to alerts only, rules only, or both.

:::{admonition} Role access to rules and alerts in 9.4
:applies_to: {"stack": "ga 9.4+", "serverless": "ga"}
Starting in {{stack}} 9.4, new custom roles require explicit **Rules and Exceptions** and **Alerts** privileges. Earlier releases sometimes granted alert-related access indirectly through broader **Security** privileges or the **Rules, Alerts, and Exceptions** feature. Review custom roles after an upgrade to confirm each role still has the intended access to alerts.
:::

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} {{serverless-full}}
Only uses the `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>` index.
::::

::::{tab-item} {{ech}}
Uses the `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>` index. If you upgraded from version 8.0 or earlier, you might also need privileges on the legacy `.siem-signals-<space-id>` index.

    - `.lists-<space-id>`
    - `.items-<space-id>`

{{kib}} privileges
:   - {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` `All` for the `Rules and Exceptions` feature and `All` for the `Alerts` feature

::::{note}
To manage rules with actions and connectors, you need additional privileges for the `Actions and Connectors` feature (`Management` > `Actions and Connectors`):

- `All`: Provides full access to rule actions and connectors.
