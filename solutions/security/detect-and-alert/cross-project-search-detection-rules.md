# {{cps-cap}} and detection rules [sec-rules-cross-project-search]

If your data spans ECH, ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters rather than linked {{serverless-short}} projects, refer to [{{ccs-cap}} and detection rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/cross-cluster-search-detection-rules.md) instead.

## {{cps-cap}} scope for rules [cps-scope-for-rules]

:::{include} /solutions/_snippets/cps-sec-obs-rules.md
:::

## API keys and linked-project access [cps-rules-api-key]

Within the rule's [{{cps}} scope](#cps-scope-for-rules), it can search only the linked projects the user who last saved it can access. For how keys are created, how role changes apply, and how to update a key, refer to [](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/rules-and-elastic-cloud-api-keys.md).

### When a rule searches the origin project only [cps-rules-origin-only-key]

If you create or update a rule through the API with an {{es}} API key, the rule keeps that credential and searches the origin project only:

- If the origin project has no matching indices, the rule doesn't run and its last-run status shows a warning.
- If those patterns exist on the origin, the rule still runs and reports success. The last-run status doesn't indicate that linked projects were skipped.

Plan for this when you migrate rules from another environment or create rules through automation. Rules still running on an {{es}} API key are tagged **Missing {{ecloud}} API Key** on the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page.

## How the alert limit applies across linked projects [cps-rules-max-alerts]

The **Max alerts per run** [advanced setting](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-ui-advanced-params) limits the number of alerts a rule creates in a single execution. Under {{cps}}, that limit covers the combined results from every project the rule queries in that run, rather than each project separately. By default, the rule queries the origin project and all linked projects in the space-level scope. The default limit is 100.

A rule that stayed under the limit on a single project can reach the limit after you link projects, which leaves matching events without alerts. Review the limit for rules that run across a broad scope. To search fewer projects instead of raising the limit, update the [space-level {{cps}} scope](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-access-and-scope.md#cps-default-search-scope), add a query-level override, or change the {{anomaly-detect}} job's {{dfeed}} scope. For which options apply to each rule type, refer to [which rule types can override the default](#cps-rules-query-overrides).

## {{cps-cap}} context in alerts and the event log [cps-context-in-alerts]

When a detection rule runs with {{cps}} enabled, the scope in effect at execution time is recorded on generated alerts and in rule execution events. During investigations, use the scope and linked project fields on the alert or in the event log to confirm which linked projects were in scope when an alert was created.

### When scope fields appear [cps-scope-fields-when]

Scope fields are written at rule execution time, not added to existing documents later. You need [linked projects](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-link-and-manage.md), a [configured space-level {{cps}} scope](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-access-and-scope.md), and at least one enabled detection rule that has run successfully with {{cps}} enabled.

On **alert documents**, `kibana.cps_scope.expression` and `kibana.cps_scope.linked_projects` are present only when that run generated an alert. Alerts created before {{cps}} was enabled are not updated retroactively.

On **event log entries**, `kibana.cps_scope_expression` and `kibana.cps_scope_linked_projects` are recorded for every {{cps}}-scoped execution, including runs that created no alerts.

### Alert documents

When a detection rule runs with {{cps}} enabled, each generated alert can include:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `kibana.cps_scope.expression` | The {{cps}} scope that was in effect when the rule generated the alert. |
| `kibana.cps_scope.linked_projects` | The linked projects that were in scope. Each entry includes `id`, `alias`, `type`, and `organization`. |

For the full list of alert fields, refer to the [alert schema](/reference/security/fields-and-object-schemas/alert-schema.md).

### Event log

Rule execution events in the [event log index](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/event-log-index.md) record the same scope and linked project information:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `kibana.cps_scope_expression` | The {{cps}} scope that was in effect during the rule execution. |
| `kibana.cps_scope_linked_projects` | The linked projects that were in scope. Each entry includes `id`, `alias`, `type`, and `organization`. |

To find rule executions that ran with a particular scope, run a search against the event log in [{{dev-tools-app}}](/explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md) or your own API client. The following example returns recent detection rule execution events that include {{cps}} scope fields:

```txt
GET .kibana-event-log-*/_search
{
  "size": 5,  <1>
  "query": {
    "match": { "kibana.cps_scope_expression": "_alias:*" }  <2>
  },
  "_source": [  <3>
    "event.action",
    "message",
    "kibana.cps_scope_expression",
    "kibana.cps_scope_linked_projects",
    "kibana.space_ids"
  ]
}
```

1. Change `size` to return more or fewer events.
2. Replace `_alias:*` with the scope you want to find. To match the scope from a specific alert, copy the value from that alert's `kibana.cps_scope.expression` field.
3. Edit the `_source` array to include the fields you need in the response.

This request searches the event log indices (`.kibana-event-log-*`) for documents that have a `kibana.cps_scope_expression` value. It limits the response to five events and returns only the fields listed in `_source`, including the {{cps}} scope, linked projects, and space ID for each execution. The event log is a system index, so by default only users with a `superuser` role can run this search. For more example queries and details on required privileges, refer to the [event log index](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/event-log-index.md).
