# Alerts in the {{alerting-v2-system-cap}} [alerts]

In the {{alerting-v2-system}}, the system tracks alerts as **alert episodes**, which represent the full lifecycle of a problem (from first detection through recovery) rather than a single point-in-time event. 

This page explains the core concepts you need to work with the {{alerting-v2-system}}: how alert episodes move through lifecycle states, and how series group episodes over time for the same monitored subject.

## Alert episode lifecycle states [alert-episode-lifecycle]

Every alert episode moves through these states:

```
inactive → pending → active → recovering → inactive
```

| State | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Inactive | Problem fully resolved. You get a recovery notification. |
| Pending | Errors detected, but the system is waiting to confirm it's a real problem before fully alerting. |
| Active | Problem confirmed and ongoing. This is when you get notified. |
| Recovering | Errors have stopped, but the system is waiting to confirm it's truly resolved. |

:::{dropdown} Example: A checkout-latency episode moving through all four states
A checkout-latency rule runs every 5 minutes. It has an activation threshold of 2 consecutive breaches and a recovery threshold of 2 consecutive clears. The episode opens only after consecutive breaches meet the activation threshold and closes only after consecutive clears meet the recovery threshold. The system waits for confirmation in both directions.

1. **14:00**: Routine check. p95 is within budget. No episode exists yet. The series is `inactive`.
2. **14:05**: p95 jumps to 3.1s. The rule detects the first breach. The system creates the episode in `pending` and starts counting consecutive breaches.
3. **14:10**: p95 is still elevated. The second consecutive breach meets the activation threshold. The episode moves from `pending` to `active`. The system pages the engineer.
4. **14:10–14:45**: Every evaluation finds high latency. The episode stays `active`. The system doesn't create new episodes. One episode tracks one problem, no matter how many times the rule evaluates while the condition holds.
5. **14:50**: p95 drops back under 2s. The first clean check moves the episode from `active` to `recovering`. The system starts counting consecutive clears.
6. **14:55**: A second consecutive clear meets the recovery threshold. The episode moves from `recovering` to `inactive`. The engineer receives a recovery notification.

**What this illustrates:**

- **`inactive` is the resting state.** The series exists but isn't tracking a problem.
- **`pending` is the confirmation gate on the way in.** Without it, a brief latency spike at 14:05 opens and immediately closes an episode, creating noise. The threshold filters that out.
- **`active` is the steady state of an ongoing problem.** The episode accumulates evaluations without branching, covering the entire outage from first confirmation to first clear.
- **`recovering` is the confirmation gate on the way out.** Without it, a single good evaluation at 14:50 closes the episode, even if latency bounces back up at 14:55. The threshold prevents premature resolution.
- **`inactive` again signals confirmed recovery.** The episode closes and the recovery notification fires only after the condition has cleared consistently.

## Alert episodes exist within a series [series-overview]

A series is the ongoing relationship between a rule and one specific thing it monitors. It exists for as long as that rule keeps monitoring that thing, and can contain many alert episodes over its lifetime, one for each time that thing had a problem.

Think of it like a patient's medical file. The file persists as long as the patient is in the system. Individual health incidents come and go, but the file stays. Each incident is an episode in the same series.

:::{tip}
Snooze operates at the series level, not the alert episode level. If you snooze `checkout-service`, you're silencing all notifications from that series for the next X hours, regardless of how many new alert episodes start during that time.

## What to do next with alerts [alerts-next-steps]

From here, you can view, manage, and query alert episode data.

- [View and manage alerts](alerts/view-and-manage-alerts.md): Open the alert episodes table, triage active episodes, and acknowledge, snooze, or resolve them.
- [Alert data model](alerts/alert-data-model.md): Understand how the system stores alert data, including the signal versus alert distinction and the two underlying data streams.
- [Query {{alerting-v2-system}} alert history in Discover](alerts/query-alerts-and-signals-in-discover.md): Use {{esql}} to query `.rule-events` and `.alert-actions` for exploratory analysis and dashboards.

:::{important} - How to use the {{alerting-v2-system}} documentation
Because the {{alerting-v2-system}} is still evolving, its UI can change before general availability. Rather than pointing to an exact button or menu, the documentation focuses on the underlying concepts and behavior. If something doesn't match what you see in the {{kib}} UI, look for the closest equivalent instead. The concepts and behaviors described in the documentation still apply.
