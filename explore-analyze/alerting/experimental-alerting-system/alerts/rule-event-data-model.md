# How {{kib}} stores rule events in the {{alerting-v2-system}} [rule-event-data-model]

{{kib}} writes **rule events** to `.rule-events`. This page covers where that data lives, which fields each `type` uses, and where triage actions go. For what a rule event is, refer to [Rule events](../rules/rule-event-field-reference.md). For how events with `type: alert` relate to an [alert episode](../alerts.md), refer to [Alerts](../alerts.md).

## What `type` records on each event [how-rule-mode-determines-output]

Every time a rule finds a match, {{kib}} writes a rule event to `.rule-events`. The event's `type` is either `signal` or `alert`:

| `type` | What the event represents |
| --- | --- |
| `signal` | Queryable in Discover for later analysis. No `episode.*` fields. |
| `alert` | One evaluation in an [alert episode](../alerts.md). Events that share `episode.id` belong to the same alert episode. |

:::{note}
Rule events with `type: signal` stay in `.rule-events`. They don't appear on **Alerts** and aren't evaluated by action policies or lifecycle triggers.
:::

## Shared index and schema [shared-index-and-schema]

Events with `type: signal` and events with `type: alert` share `.rule-events` and many of the same fields, including `data`, the payload from your rule's query. Filter with `WHERE type == "signal"` or `WHERE type == "alert"`.

Only `type: alert` events carry the `episode.*` fields that track lifecycle state (`episode.id`, `episode.status`, `episode.status_count`). Query those events by `episode.id` to replay an alert episode. Events with `type: signal` don't include `episode.*` fields.

For the full field list, including field types and which fields apply to each `type`, refer to [Field reference](field-reference.md#rule-events-field-schema).

## How {{kib}} records evaluation and triage data [how-kib-records-evaluation-triage-data]

{{kib}} writes rule output to the following append-only data streams, both managed through [index lifecycle management (ILM)](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management.md) and queryable with {{esql}} in Discover:

- **`.rule-events`** - {{kib}} writes one rule event per matching row, per run, and never overwrites them. When {{kib}} tracks an alert episode, it can also write `recovered` and `no_data` events. This stream holds events with `type: signal` and events with `type: alert`.
- **`.alert-actions`** - Records every triage action taken on an alert episode (for example, acknowledge, snooze, and resolve). Only alert episodes produce documents here.
