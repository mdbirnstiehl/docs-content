# Review rule execution history in the {{alerting-v2-system}} [review-rule-execution-history]

Rule execution history gives you a cross-rule, filterable log of every rule run in the space.

<!-- TODO: When PR #6525 (action policies) merges and its dedicated execution history page exists, add a "Related pages" section here linking to it. -->

## Rule executions [rule-execution-records]

Rule execution history shows one row per rule evaluation across all rules in the space. Use it to spot patterns that aren't visible when looking at individual rules, for example, a cluster of failures at the same timestamp that points to a shared dependency issue.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Timestamp** | When the rule execution ran. |
| **Rule** | The rule that ran. Selecting the rule name opens a summary so you can inspect the rule without leaving the page. |
| **Duration** | How long the execution took. |
| **Response** | The outcome of the run: `success` or `failure`. |
| **Message** | An optional message included with the execution result, typically an error description for failed runs. |

Use the outcome filter to view only successful or failed executions. Filtering is applied server-side. Results are paginated up to 100 per page. You can page through up to 10,000 records — this is a pagination ceiling, not a retention limit. Deeper history exists in the event log but is not reachable by paging further.
