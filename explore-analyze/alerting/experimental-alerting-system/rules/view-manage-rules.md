# View and manage rules in the {{alerting-v2-system}} [manage-rules]

Rule management is part of the {{alerting-v2-system}} in {{kib}}. This page covers how to find and filter rules in the rules list, quick-edit settings without leaving the list, use the rule summary flyout, and navigate the rule details page including the alert activity timeline.

## Find and filter rules [find-filter-rules]

Use the search bar to find rules by name or description. Each space-separated term is matched independently using prefix matching. Tags and grouping fields appear in results but aren't searchable.

Combine text search with filter controls to narrow by rule type, status, or tags. Select any column header to sort, or use bulk actions to enable, disable, or delete multiple rules at once.

## Edit a rule inline [quick-edit-rule]

To update common rule settings without opening the full rule details page, use the inline edit option on any row in the rules list. The inline editor also opens from the rule summary flyout header.

Use inline edit when you need to adjust metadata or scheduling settings quickly without navigating away from the list.

## Inspect a rule with the summary flyout [rule-summary-flyout]

To inspect a rule without navigating away from the rules list, select the expand icon on any row. The rule summary flyout opens alongside the list and shows a snapshot of the rule: its status, last run time, recent alert episode activity, and quick actions such as enable, disable, and snooze.

Use the flyout when you want to confirm a rule is healthy or take a quick action without committing to a full page load. To open the complete rule configuration with all settings and edit controls, select the rule name in the table row or in the flyout header.

## Review rule configuration and activity [rule-details-page]

The rule details page is organized into tabs that let you review a rule's configuration and activity history.

- **Overview** (Alert mode only): Shows a color-coded alert activity timeline per series, with summary statistics (episodes started, recovered, still open, and median duration) and a link to view matching episodes.
- **Conditions**: The rule's base query, alert condition, schedule, lookback, grouping, and recovery settings.
- **Runbook**: The rule's investigation guide, if one has been added. Use it to document steps for diagnosing or responding to alerts produced by this rule.

Use **Edit** to modify the rule, or the actions menu to enable, disable, clone, or delete it.

## Disable or snooze a rule [disable-snooze-rule]

Use **Disable** when you want the rule to stop running entirely until you re-enable it. This is different from snoozing, which suppresses notifications or quiets a series or action policy without stopping rule evaluation.
