# Configure a rule in the {{alerting-v2-system}} [rule-settings]

Rules in the {{alerting-v2-system}} have three required settings and several optional ones. Start with the required settings in order. Only add optional settings once the detection logic is validated, for example by previewing results in the [query sandbox](create-esql-rule.md#rule-builder-query-sandbox) when writing {{esql}} directly. The following table links to a dedicated page for each setting with field descriptions, accepted values, and guidance on when to configure it.

| Setting | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rule mode](configure-rule-mode.md) | Can be Signal or Alert. Controls whether matching rows generate signal documents or tracked alert episodes. | Required |
| [{{esql}} query](configure-rule-query.md) | The detection logic and the parameters available in query expressions. | Required |
| [Schedule and lookback](configure-rule-schedule.md) | How often the rule evaluates and how far back the query looks. | Required |
| [Severity](configure-rule-severity.md) | Assign severity levels to alert episodes using a `severity` column in query output. | Optional |
| [Grouping](configure-rule-grouping.md) | Track multiple subjects (hosts, services, users) as independent alert series in one rule. | Optional |
| [Alert delay](configure-rule-alert-delay.md) | Reduce noise with delay modes for opening alert episodes. Alert mode only. | Optional |
| [Recovery condition](configure-rule-recovery.md) | Whether an alert episode closes automatically, and how much confirmation it needs before it does. Alert mode only. | Optional |
| [No-data handling](configure-no-data-handling.md) | What the rule records when the base query returns no results. | Optional |
| [Tags and runbooks](configure-rule-tags.md) | Free-form labels and investigation guides attached to the rule. Alert mode only. | Optional |
