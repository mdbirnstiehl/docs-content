# Manage severity escalation notifications for the {{alerting-v2-system}} [severity-escalation]

Use this page to control when a workflow runs as an alert episode's severity changes, including first-time matches, duplicate invocations, and de-escalation. Not every severity change invokes a workflow. The outcome depends on whether the action policy has already matched the alert episode and which frequency option you've selected.

## Notify when an alert episode escalates into a new severity threshold

Scope an action policy to the severity level you want a workflow to run for. When an alert episode escalates into that severity level for the first time, the action policy invokes a workflow because it has no prior invocation record for the alert episode.

The following example uses an action policy scoped to `severity: "critical"`. An alert episode starts at `low` severity, so the action policy doesn't match. When the alert episode escalates to `critical`, the action policy now matches and invokes a workflow regardless of the frequency setting, because it has never invoked a workflow for this alert episode before.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Match conditions** | `severity: "critical"` |
| **Notify per** | Episode |
| **Frequency** | On status change |
| **Destinations** | PagerDuty workflow |

## Prevent duplicate notifications when severity changes within an existing match

If an action policy already matched an alert episode, a severity escalation alone doesn't trigger re-notification when the alert episode's status stays the same. With `On status change` frequency, a severity change doesn't count as a status change.

In this example, Action Policy A matches all alert episodes regardless of severity and notified when the alert episode was `low`. When the alert episode escalates to `critical`, Action Policy A still matches, but the throttle blocks re-notification because the status hasn't changed. To re-notify on escalation, use a time-based throttle or create separate action policies for each severity level as described in [Route alert episodes by severity](route-by-severity.md).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Match conditions** | (None, matches all alert episodes) |
| **Notify per** | Episode |
| **Frequency** | On status change |
| **Destinations** | Slack workflow |

## Stop notifications when an alert episode de-escalates below an action policy's threshold

If an alert episode drops below an action policy's severity threshold, the action policy stops matching and doesn't invoke a workflow. If the alert episode later escalates back above the threshold, the action policy invokes a workflow again as if it were the first match.

In this example, Action Policy B targets only `severity: "critical"` alert episodes. An alert episode de-escalates from `critical` to `high`. Action Policy B no longer matches and stops invoking a workflow. If the alert episode later escalates back to `critical`, Action Policy B invokes a workflow again.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Match conditions** | `severity: "critical"` |
| **Notify per** | Episode |
| **Frequency** | On status change |
| **Destinations** | PagerDuty workflow |
