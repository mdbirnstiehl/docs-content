# Route alert episodes by severity in the {{alerting-v2-system}} [route-by-severity]

Use this page to send critical and non-critical alert episodes to different workflows by scoping one action policy per severity.

For example, you might page an on-call team for critical alert episodes while sending lower-severity alert episodes to a Slack channel for async review.

| Field | Action Policy A | Action Policy B |
|---|---|---|
| **Match conditions** | `severity: "critical"` | `severity: "low" OR severity: "medium" OR severity: "high"` |
| **Notify per** | Episode | Episode |
| **Frequency** | On status change | On status change |
| **Destinations** | PagerDuty workflow | Slack workflow |

Each action policy evaluates alert episodes independently.

- An alert episode with `severity: "critical"` matches Action Policy A but not Action Policy B.
- An alert episode with `severity: "high"` matches Action Policy B but not Action Policy A.
- If an alert episode's severity changes mid-lifecycle, the action policies that match it change accordingly. For example, if an alert episode escalates from `high` to `critical`, Action Policy A starts matching and Action Policy B stops matching. Action Policy A fires because it has no prior notification record for that alert episode.
