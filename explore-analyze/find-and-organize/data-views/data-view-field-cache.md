# Data view field cache

The browser caches {{data-source}} field lists to improve performance. Caching matters most for {{data-sources}} with a high field count that span many indices and clusters.

In typical {{kib}} usage, the field list updates every few minutes. To get an updated list immediately, select **Refresh** on the {{data-source}} management detail page. Clearing your browser cache has the same effect.

The field list might change after updates to indices or user privileges.
