# Create a data view

Create a {{data-source}} to make your own {{es}} data available in **Discover**, **Lens**, and other analytics features. You can save it for the space, or use it without saving:

* [Create the data view](#create-data-view-steps): Save it so others in the space can use it.
* [Create a temporary {{data-source}}](#_create_a_temporary_data_source): Select **Use without saving** in **Discover** or **Lens**. It isn't visible to others, and it lasts until you change apps or save it.

## Before you begin [create-data-view-prereqs]

* You need a role with the **Data View Management** {{kib}} privilege and the `view_index_metadata` {{es}} privilege. Refer to [Defining roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md).
* If a **Read only** badge appears, you don't have sufficient privileges to create or save {{data-sources}}.
* You need data already indexed into {{es}}. Some workflows create a {{data-source}} for you automatically instead. Refer to [How data views are created](../data-views.md#data-views-how-you-get-one).

## Create the data view [create-data-view-steps]

1. Open the create form:

   * In **Discover** or **Lens**, open the data view menu, then select **Create a {{data-source}}**.
   * Go to the **Data Views** management page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md), then select **Create data view**.

   :::

2. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the {{data-source}}.
3. In the **Index pattern** field, enter a pattern. {{kib}} looks for the names of indices, data streams, and aliases that match your input. You can view all available sources or only the sources that the data view targets.

   If you have a high number of matching sources, not all of them might show:

    * {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.6+` The preview can show up to 10,000 sources.
    * {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.5` The preview can show up to 100 sources.

   ![Create data view](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-create-data-view.png "")

    * To match multiple sources, use a wildcard (`*`). `filebeat-*` matches `filebeat-apache-a`, `filebeat-apache-b`, and so on.
    * To match several individual sources, enter their names, separated by a comma, with no space after the comma. `filebeat-a,filebeat-b` matches two indices.
    * To exclude a source, use a minus sign (`-`), for example `-test3`.

   For data in another cluster, another project, or a rollup index, refer to [What the index pattern matches](#what-the-index-pattern-matches).

4. Open the **Timestamp field** menu, then select the default field for filtering your data by time.

    * If you don't set a default time field, you can't use global time filters on your dashboards. Skip a default time field when you have multiple time fields and want to combine visualizations that use different timestamps.
    * If your index doesn't have time-based data, select **I don't want to use the time filter**.

5. Select **Show advanced settings** to:

    * Allow hidden and system indices.
    * Set a **Custom data view ID**. By default, {{kib}} assigns a randomly generated ID to the {{data-source}} saved object. A custom, human-readable ID (for example, `logs-prod`) makes the {{data-source}} easier to recreate with the same ID across spaces, deployments, or environments. Dashboards and visualizations that reference that ID keep working. Refer to [Manage dashboards as code](/explore-analyze/dashboards/manage-dashboards-as-code.md).

6. $$$reload-fields$$$ Select **Save {{data-source}} to {{kib}}**.

You can now select your new {{data-source}} from the data view menu in **Discover**, **Lens**, and other analytics features. Manage it from the **Data Views** management page.

## What the index pattern matches [what-the-index-pattern-matches]

The **Index pattern** field tells the {{data-source}} which names to query. What you enter depends on where the data lives:

* [Data in this cluster or project](#index-pattern-local): Wildcards, comma-separated names, or a minus sign to exclude
* [Data in another cluster](#management-cross-cluster-search): Use `cluster:index` syntax for {{ccs}}
* [Data in another project](#management-cross-project-search): Qualified expressions for {{cps}}
* [Rolled-up data](#rollup-data-view): One rollup index, or rollup and raw data together

### Data in this cluster or project [index-pattern-local]

* To match multiple sources, use a wildcard (`*`). `filebeat-*` matches `filebeat-apache-a`, `filebeat-apache-b`, and so on.
* To match several individual sources, enter their names, separated by a comma, with no space after the comma. `filebeat-a,filebeat-b` matches two indices.
* To exclude a source, use a minus sign (`-`), for example `-test3`.

### Data in another cluster [management-cross-cluster-search]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga
serverless: unavailable
```

If your {{es}} clusters are configured for [{{ccs}}](/explore-analyze/cross-cluster-search.md), you can create a {{data-source}} to search across the clusters of your choosing. Specify data streams, indices, and aliases in a remote cluster using the following syntax:

```ts
<remote_cluster_name>:<target>
```

To query {{ls}} indices across two {{es}} clusters that you set up for {{ccs}}, named `cluster_one` and `cluster_two`:

```ts
cluster_one:logstash-*,cluster_two:logstash-*
```

Use wildcards in your cluster names to match any number of clusters. To search {{ls}} indices across clusters named `cluster_foo`, `cluster_bar`, and so on:

```ts
cluster_*:logstash-*
```

To query across all {{es}} clusters that have been configured for {{ccs}}, use a standalone wildcard for your cluster name:

```ts
*:logstash-*
```

To match indices starting with `logstash-`, but exclude those starting with `logstash-old`, from all clusters having a name starting with `cluster_`:

```ts
cluster_*:logstash-*,cluster_*:-logstash-old*
```

Excluding a cluster avoids sending any network calls to that cluster. To exclude a cluster with the name `cluster_one`:

```ts
cluster_*:logstash-*,-cluster_one:*
```

After you configure a {{data-source}} to use the {{ccs}} syntax, all searches and aggregations using that {{data-source}} in {{kib}} take advantage of {{ccs}}.

For more information, refer to [Excluding clusters or indices from cross-cluster search](/explore-analyze/cross-cluster-search.md#exclude-problematic-clusters).

### Data in another project [management-cross-project-search]
```{applies_to}
serverless: ga
stack: unavailable
```

After you [link projects](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-link-and-manage.md), the {{data-source}} creation form previews matching indices from those projects based on the current [{{cps}} scope](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-manage-scope.md#cps-in-kibana). The {{data-source}} itself doesn't store the scope. When you query the {{data-source}}, results come from whichever linked projects the active {{cps}} scope includes at that time.

To restrict a {{data-source}} to specific projects regardless of the active scope, you can:

* Use [qualified expressions](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-search.md#search-expressions) in the index pattern to target specific projects, for example `project_alpha:logs-*,project_beta:logs-*`. To search only the origin project, use `_origin:logs-*`.
* Use [project routing](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-project-routing.md) in your queries to narrow scope at query time.

### Rolled-up data [rollup-data-view]
```{applies_to}
stack: deprecated
serverless: unavailable
```

:::{warning}
Rollups are deprecated. Use [downsampling](/manage-data/data-store/data-streams/downsampling-time-series-data-stream.md) instead.
:::

A {{data-source}} can match one rollup index. For a combination rollup {{data-source}} with both raw and rolled up data, use the standard notation:

```ts
rollup_logstash,kibana_sample_data_logs
```

For an example, refer to [Create and visualize rolled up data](/manage-data/lifecycle/rollup/getting-started-kibana.md#rollup-data-tutorial).

## Create a temporary {{data-source}} [_create_a_temporary_data_source]

To explore data or build a visualization without saving a {{data-source}}, select **Use without saving** in the **Create {{data-source}}** form in **Discover** or **Lens**. With a temporary {{data-source}}, you can add fields and create an {{es}} query alert, the same way you would with a saved {{data-source}}. Your work isn't visible to others in your space.

A temporary {{data-source}} remains in your space until you change apps, or until you save it.

Temporary {{data-sources}} aren't available on the **Data Views** management page. **Use without saving** appears only in **Discover** and **Lens**.
