# Duplicate a data view

Duplicating a data view creates an editable copy. Use a copy when you want to try different field formatting or a different index pattern without affecting the original, or when you need a similar {{data-source}} for another use case.

{applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2` Duplicating is also how you customize a [managed](../data-views.md#managed-data-views) {{data-source}}. You can't edit a managed {{data-source}} directly.

## Before you begin [duplicate-data-view-prereqs]

* You need a role with the **Data View Management** {{kib}} privilege and the `view_index_metadata` {{es}} privilege. Refer to [Defining roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md).
* You need an existing data view to duplicate.

## Duplicate a data view [duplicate-data-view-steps]

1. Open **Discover** or **Lens**.

   :::{note}
   Duplication isn't available from the **Data Views** management page.
   :::

2. In the data view menu, select the data view that you want to duplicate.
3. Still in the data view menu, select **Manage this data view**. A flyout with more details about the data view opens. For a managed {{data-source}}, it indicates that you can't edit it directly.

4. Select **Duplicate**. A similar flyout opens where you can adjust the settings of the new copy.
5. Finish your edits, then select **Save data view to Kibana** or **Use without saving**.

If you save it to {{kib}}, the new, editable {{data-source}} appears in the data view menu and on the **Data Views** management page, separate from the one you duplicated.
