# Data views

A {{data-source}} tells {{kib}} which {{es}} indices, [data streams](../../manage-data/data-store/data-streams.md), or [index aliases](/manage-data/data-store/aliases.md) to query. Analytics features such as **Discover** and **Lens** use a {{data-source}} to access your data. For example, a {{data-source}} can point to your log data from yesterday, or to all indices that contain your data.

::::{note}
In some apps, you can query {{es}} with [{{esql}}](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql.md) instead. {{esql}} doesn't require a {{data-source}}.

## How data views are created [data-views-how-you-get-one]

A {{data-source}} in your space is created automatically or by you.

**Created automatically**
:   Some ingest and onboarding workflows create a {{data-source}} for you. Adding [sample data](../../manage-data/ingest/sample-data.md) installs one. [Uploading a file](../../manage-data/ingest/upload-data-files.md) creates one when **Create data view** is turned on. These are ordinary {{data-sources}} that you can edit.

    Installing an Elastic integration through Fleet also creates {{data-sources}}. Those {{data-sources}} are [managed by Elastic](#managed-data-views).

**Created by you**
:   For your own data, you often need to create the {{data-source}} yourself. Refer to [Create a data view](data-views/create-data-view.md).

To see which {{data-sources}} already exist in your space, open the data view menu in **Discover** or **Lens**, or go to the **Data Views** management page.

## Managed data views [managed-data-views]

Some {{data-sources}} are configured and managed by Elastic, including those created by Fleet integrations, {{elastic-sec}}, and Cases. Managed {{data-sources}} carry a **Managed** tag.

You can view and use a managed {{data-source}}, but you can't edit it.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4` You also can't delete a managed {{data-source}}.

To customize a managed {{data-source}}, [duplicate it](data-views/duplicate-data-view.md) and edit the copy.

## Search across clusters, projects, or rolled-up data [management-cross-cluster-search]

To match data in another cluster, another project, or a rollup index, refer to [What the index pattern matches](data-views/create-data-view.md#what-the-index-pattern-matches).
