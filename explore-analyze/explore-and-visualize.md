# Explore and visualize your data

The {{es}} platform provides tools to explore, visualize, and monitor your data. They are available across all Elastic solutions and project types.

The typical workflow progresses through three stages:

1. **Explore** your data interactively with Discover.
2. **Compose a dashboard** for your team to use for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.
3. **Fill it with panels and visualizations** built with Lens and other editors.

## Start exploring with Discover

[Discover](discover.md) gives you direct access to documents in your {{es}} indices to search, filter, and examine data in real time.

With Discover, you can:

- Search using KQL, Lucene, or {{esql}}
- Drill into individual documents and compare fields across records
- Spot patterns in your log data
- Save sessions and add them to dashboards

## Compose views for monitoring and sharing with dashboards

[Dashboards](dashboards.md) bring multiple visualizations together into a single, interactive view. They combine charts, metrics, maps, and text, and anyone on your team can use filters, time controls, and drilldowns to explore further.

Dashboards are the primary way teams monitor deployment health, security posture, business metrics, or application performance. They're also shareable, embeddable, and can power scheduled reports.

## Add building blocks to your dashboards with panels and visualizations

Every chart, table, map, or metric on a dashboard is a **panel**. [Panels and visualizations](visualize.md) are the building blocks you use to represent your data visually.

- **Lens**: drag-and-drop editor for charts, tables, metrics, and more. Lens also supports an {{esql}} query mode for building visualizations directly from queries.
- **Maps**: geospatial data visualization
- **Canvas**: dynamic, multi-page presentations combining live data with custom styling, images, and text
- **Vega**: fully custom visualizations

You can also add context with text, images, and link panels.

## Find and organize your content

As your collection grows, these tools help you keep everything organized:

- [{{data-sources-cap}}](find-and-organize/data-views.md): define which {{es}} indices a visualization or Discover session queries
- [Tags](find-and-organize/tags.md) and [spaces](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md): group related content by team, project, or domain
- [Saved objects](find-and-organize/saved-objects.md): manage and export your dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches

## How these tools work across Elastic solutions

These capabilities form a shared foundation across all Elastic solutions:

- **{{product.observability}}**: dashboards and Discover surface infrastructure metrics, application traces, and log patterns. SLO panels and anomaly charts plug directly into dashboards.
- **{{elastic-sec}}**: specialized views for detection alerts, investigation timelines, and threat intelligence, built on the same dashboard and visualization infrastructure.
- **{{es}} projects**: search analytics, relevance tuning, and content exploration.

These tools and workflows apply to every solution and project type.
