# Link projects for {{cps}} [link-projects-for-cps]

Before you can search across multiple projects, you must link them together. {{cps-cap}} only works between projects that are explicitly linked within your {{ecloud}} organization.

This guide explains how to link projects in the {{ecloud}} UI so you can run cross-project searches from an origin project. For an overview of {{cps}} concepts such as origin projects, linked projects, and search expressions, refer to [{{cps-cap}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search.md).

## Prerequisites

* {{cps-cap}} requires linked projects.
<!-- To set up linked projects, refer to . -->
<!-- * Pricing info -->
<!-- * {{cps-cap}} requires [UIAM](TODO) set up. -->
