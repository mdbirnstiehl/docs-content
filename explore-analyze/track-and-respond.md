# Track and respond

The {{es}} platform provides tools to share insights, get notified about important changes, and track incidents. These tools work together across every Elastic solution and project type.

## Distribute insights with reporting and sharing

[Reporting and sharing](report-and-share.md) lets you export and distribute dashboards, Discover sessions, and visualizations, including to people who don't log into {{kib}}.

- Generate reports on demand or [schedule them automatically](report-and-share/automating-report-generation.md)
- Export as PDF, PNG snapshots, or CSV files
- Share direct links to live dashboards with real-time, filtered views

## Get notified when it matters with alerting

[Alerting](alerting.md) monitors your {{es}} data continuously and notifies you when specific conditions are met, so you don't have to watch dashboards around the clock.

Define rules that evaluate your data on a schedule and trigger actions when criteria are met:

- **Threshold rules**: notify you when error rates spike
- **Machine learning rules**: alert on anomalies
- **Geo-containment rules**: track assets leaving a defined area

Notifications go where your team already works: email, Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, webhooks, and more.

Elastic solutions extend this foundation with domain-specific rules. Security detection rules match threat patterns, while Observability rules monitor SLOs, infrastructure metrics, and log error rates. All rules share the same interface, action framework, and notification channels.

Alerts can also trigger [workflows](/explore-analyze/workflows.md) to automate multi-step responses, such as enriching an alert with context, creating a case, or notifying the on-call team.

## Track and coordinate response with cases

[Cases](cases.md) provide a central place to track incidents, document findings, and coordinate response efforts across your team.

- Attach alerts, files, and visualizations to build a record of your investigation
- Assign team members and add comments
- Push updates to external systems like Jira or ServiceNow

Cases are available in {{elastic-sec}}, Observability, and Stack Management.

## How these tools work together

These capabilities chain together naturally:

1. A **dashboard** reveals a pattern, such as error rates climbing for a specific service.
2. An **alert rule** detects the threshold breach and sends a notification.
3. A **case** tracks the investigation, collecting related alerts, team comments, and resolution steps.
4. A **scheduled report** captures the post-incident dashboard state and distributes it to stakeholders.

For more complex scenarios, [workflows](/explore-analyze/workflows.md) can automate the steps between detection and resolution — creating cases, notifying teams, and taking action without human intervention.

## Next steps

- **[Automatically generate reports](report-and-share/automating-report-generation.md)**: Set up recurring report delivery for your dashboards.
- **[Getting started with alerting](alerting/alerts/alerting-getting-started.md)**: Create your first alert rule and configure notification channels.
- **[Create a case](cases/create-cases.md)**: Start tracking an incident and attach relevant alerts and evidence.
