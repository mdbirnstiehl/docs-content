# Manage drilldowns [manage-drilldowns]

You can edit a drilldown, copy it, or delete it. You can also reuse a drilldown from another panel on the same dashboard.

For the dashboard, URL, and Discover types, refer to [Drilldowns](drilldowns.md).

## Before you begin [manage-drilldowns-requirements]

To manage a drilldown, you need:

:::{include} _snippets/drilldown-access.md
:::

The panel already has a drilldown. To reuse one, another panel on the same dashboard already has a drilldown whose trigger this panel supports.

## Edit, copy, or delete a drilldown [edit-copy-or-delete-a-drilldown]

1. On the dashboard, select **Edit**.
2. Open the panel menu that includes the drilldown, then select **Manage drilldowns**.
3. On the **Manage** tab, use the following options:

    * To change a drilldown, select **Edit**, make your changes, then select **Save**.
    * To make another copy on the same panel, select **Copy**, then select **Create drilldown**. The name ends with `(copy)`.
    * To delete a drilldown, select it, then select **Delete**.

## Reuse a drilldown on another panel [reuse-a-drilldown-on-another-panel]

On the dashboard, select **Edit**. Open the panel menu on the panel that should get the drilldown, then select {icon}`plus_in_circle` **Create drilldown**. **Copy existing drilldown** lists drilldowns whose trigger this panel supports, with the source panel title under the drilldown name. Select **Copy**, then select **Create drilldown**. If this panel does not support the trigger, the name shows a warning.
