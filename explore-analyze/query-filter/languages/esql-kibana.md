# Use ES|QL in the {{kib}} UI [esql-kibana]

The {{esql}} editor lets you write, run, and manage [{{esql}}](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax-reference.md) queries across {{kib}}. Use it to query and aggregate your data, create visualizations, and set up alerts.

The {{esql}} editor is available in the following areas of {{kib}}:

- [**Discover**](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md): Explore and analyze your data using {{esql}} queries, visualize results, and save your findings to dashboards.
- [**Dashboards**](/explore-analyze/dashboards.md): Create {{esql}}-powered visualization panels and interactive controls.
- [**Alerting**](/explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/rule-type-es-query.md): Create alerting rules based on {{esql}} queries.
- [**{{elastic-sec}} solution**](/solutions/security/esql-for-security.md): Use {{esql}} for threat hunting, detection rules, and investigation workflows.

## Write queries with the {{esql}} editor [esql-kibana-get-started]


### Query structure [esql-kibana-query-bar]

Every {{esql}} query starts with a [source command](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-source-commands) that retrieves data:

- [`FROM`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/source-commands.md#esql-from) retrieves data from data streams, indices, or aliases.
- [`TS`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/ts.md) is optimized for querying time series data streams.

You can then chain one or more [processing commands](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-processing-commands) using pipe (`|`) characters. For example, [`WHERE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-where) filters rows and [`STATS`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-stats-by) aggregates data:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE response.keyword == "200"
| STATS total_bytes = SUM(bytes) BY geo.dest
```

When querying many indices at once without filters, the response might be too large. If you encounter a content length error, use [`DROP`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-drop) or [`KEEP`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-keep) to limit the number of fields returned.

::::{note}
{{esql}} keywords are case-insensitive. `FROM`, `from`, and `From` are all equivalent.
::::


### Editor tools

The {{esql}} editor includes several built-in tools to help you write queries efficiently.

#### Autocomplete and in-app help

{{esql}} features in-app help, inline suggestions, and an autocomplete menu so you can get started faster and don't have to leave the application to check syntax.

![The ES|QL syntax reference and the autocomplete menu](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-esql-in-app-help.png "")

#### Query formatting [_make_your_query_readable]

For readability, you can put each processing command on a new line and add indentation. Use the {icon}`pipeBreaks` **Prettify query** button from the query editor's footer to format your query automatically. You can also adjust the editor's height by dragging its bottom border.

#### Warnings [_warnings]

A query might result in warnings, for example when querying an unsupported field type. When that happens, the query bar displays a warning symbol. To see the detailed warning, expand the query bar, and select **warnings**.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

| Mac                | Windows/Linux       | Description                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| {kbd}`cmd+enter`   | {kbd}`ctrl+enter`   | Run a query                 |
| {kbd}`cmd+/`       | {kbd}`ctrl+/`       | Comment or uncomment a line |
| {kbd}`cmd+k`       | {kbd}`ctrl+k`       | Open [Quick search](#esql-kibana-quick-search) |

:::{tip}
You can find the list of shortcuts directly from the editor. Look for the ![keyboard](../../images/keyboard.svg "keyboard =2%") icon.
:::


### Free-text quick search [esql-kibana-quick-search]
```{applies_to}
serverless: preview
stack: preview 9.3+
```

You can use the **Quick search** functionality of the {{esql}} editor to translate a free-text search into a functioning {{esql}} query with a `WHERE KQL()` clause. This can be useful if you're getting started with {{esql}} and are familiar with [KQL](kql.md). 

1. Select **Quick search** in the editor's footer, or press {kbd}`cmd+k` (Mac) or {kbd}`ctrl+k` (Windows/Linux) to open the **Quick search** bar.
2. Select the data sources to search.
3. Type the text you want to search for.
4. Submit your search by pressing **Enter**. The editor generates a new {{esql}} query that overwrites the current query. It includes a `FROM` command based on the data sources you selected (or `TS` if the data source is a time series data stream), and a `WHERE KQL()` command that contains the text you typed in the search bar. The editor saves previously run queries in the query history if you need to restore them. 
5. Refine your query with any other {{esql}} command or function that you need. The **Quick search** bar closes automatically when you start typing in the editor or select outside of it.

![Quick search bar in the ES|QL editor](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc8165d27051bdac3/6966744e818dc30008b336f8/esql-quick-search.gif "=60%")


### Commands with additional editor support

Some {{esql}} commands have dedicated editor features beyond autocomplete, such as in-editor index or policy creation.

#### LOOKUP JOIN command and lookup indices

The {{esql}} editor supports [`LOOKUP JOIN`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-lookup-join) commands and suggests lookup mode indices and join condition fields.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2.0` Remote lookup joins are supported in [cross-cluster queries](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-cross-clusters.md). The lookup index must exist on _all_ remote clusters being queried, because each cluster uses its local lookup index data.

![Using the LOOKUP JOIN command to autocomplete an ES|QL query](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blte43a30a93241d650/67c23670045f5839e5bfd1e4/lookup-join-demo.gif)

In **Discover**, LOOKUP JOIN commands let you create or edit lookup indices directly from the editor. Find more information in [](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md#discover-esql-lookup-join).


#### ENRICH command and enrich policies [esql-kibana-enrich]

The {{esql}} [`ENRICH`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-enrich) command enables you to [enrich](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md) your query dataset with fields from another dataset. Before you can use `ENRICH`, you need to [create and execute an enrich policy](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md#esql-set-up-enrich-policy). If a policy exists, autocomplete suggests it. If not, select **Click to create** to create one.

:::{image} /explore-analyze/images/elasticsearch-reference-esql-kibana-enrich-autocomplete.png

:width: 50%
:::

For detailed steps to create an enrich policy from the editor, refer to [Enrich your data](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md).


## Filter by time [esql-kibana-time-filter]

To display data within a specified time range, you can use the standard time filter, custom time parameters, or a WHERE command.


### Standard time filter [_standard_time_filter]

{{kib}} enables the standard [time filter](../filtering.md) when the indices you're querying have a field named `@timestamp`.


### Custom time parameters [_custom_time_parameters]

If your indices do not have a field named `@timestamp`, you can use the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters to specify a time range. These parameters work with any timestamp field and automatically sync with the [time filter](../filtering.md).

```esql
FROM my_index
| WHERE custom_timestamp >= ?_tstart AND custom_timestamp < ?_tend
```

You can also use the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters with the [`BUCKET`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/grouping-functions.md#esql-bucket) function to create auto-incrementing time buckets in {{esql}} visualizations. For example:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| STATS average_bytes = AVG(bytes) BY BUCKET(@timestamp, 50, ?_tstart, ?_tend)
```


### Time ranges with WHERE [_where_command]

You can also limit the time range using the [`WHERE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-where) command and the [`NOW`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/date-time-functions.md#esql-now) function. For example, if the timestamp field is called `timestamp`, to query the last 15 minutes of data:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE timestamp > NOW() - 15minutes
```


## Use variables and controls [add-variable-control]

{{esql}} variables help you add interactive controls to your queries and make them more dynamic.

They're available for:
* [Discover queries](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md#add-variable-control) {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2`
* [{{esql}} visualizations in dashboards](/explore-analyze/dashboards/add-controls.md#add-variable-control)

## Manage queries

The {{esql}} editor keeps track of your queries so you can reuse and organize them.

### Query history [esql-kibana-query-history]

You can reuse your recent {{esql}} queries in the query bar. In the query bar, select **Show recent queries**.

You can then: 
- scroll through your most recent queries
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2` search for specific queries of your history

:::{image} /explore-analyze/images/esql-history.gif
:alt: esql discover query history
:width: 75%
:::

:::{note}
The maximum number of queries in the history depends on the version you're using:
- {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2+` The query history can keep up to 50 KB of queries, which represents about 200 large queries, or about 300 short queries.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.1` The query history keeps your 20 most recent queries.
:::

### Starred queries [esql-kibana-starred-queries]

From the query history, you can mark some queries as favorite to find and access them faster later.

In the query bar, select **Show recent queries**.

From the **Recent** tab, you can star any queries you want.

In the **Starred** tab, find all the queries you have previously starred.
