# Revoke an MCP client or connection [mcp-client-revoke]

Revoking OAuth access in {{agent-builder}} immediately cuts off an MCP host's ability to use the Agent Builder tools. You can revoke at two granularities: a single user's connection, or the entire MCP client and all its connections.

- **Revoke a connection** — removes one user's authorized session for an MCP client, while leaving the client registered. The user can reconnect by going through the consent flow again.
- **Revoke an MCP client** — revokes the entire client and all its connections. Users whose connections are removed can no longer connect until a new client is created.

There is no OAuth `/revoke` endpoint. All revocation is through the {{kib}} and {{ecloud}} interfaces.

:::{tip}
Organization owners and project administrators can also revoke connections from the Cloud Console. See [Manage application connections](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-mcp-client-connections.md).

## Revoke a connection

Any user with access to the project can revoke connections from the **Application connections** page in Security Management.

1. In {{kib}}, go to **Agent Builder → Tools library**, click **Manage MCP**, and select **Manage MCP clients (OAuth)**. Then click **Manage application connections**. Alternatively, go to **Admin and settings → Application connections**.
2. Find the connection. In **Group by client** view, expand a client row to see its connections. Switch to **List view** to see all connections in a flat list.
3. Click **Revoke** in the connection's row.
4. Review the details in the confirmation dialog, then click **Revoke**.

The connection is revoked immediately. The MCP client stays registered and can accept new connections. Applications can be reconnected at any time by going through the consent flow again.

## Revoke multiple connections

1. In {{kib}}, go to **Admin and settings → Application connections** (or click **Manage application connections** from **Agent Builder → Tools library → Manage MCP → Manage MCP clients (OAuth)**).
2. Select the checkbox next to each connection you want to revoke. To select all connections for a client, select the checkbox in the client's row.
3. Click **Revoke *N* connections**.
4. Review the list in the confirmation dialog, then click **Revoke**.

## Revoke an MCP client

Revoking a client immediately terminates all its connections. The client is no longer listed in Agent Builder, and existing OAuth tokens for those connections stop working at the next validation.

1. In {{kib}}, go to **Agent Builder → Tools library**, click **Manage MCP**, and select **Manage MCP clients (OAuth)**.
2. Find the client and click **Revoke** in its row.
3. In the **Revoke [client name]?** dialog, review the number of active connections that will be affected.
4. In the **MCP client name** field, type the client name exactly as shown to confirm, then click **Revoke**.

After revocation, users can no longer connect with that client until a new MCP client is created.

:::{note}
Removing a user from your identity provider does **not** automatically revoke that user's connections. Revoke their connections manually when offboarding.

## Next steps

- If you revoked a client and want to restore access, [create a new MCP client](mcp-client-create.md) and distribute the new credentials to users.
