# Get started with {{context-engine}}

:::{include} _snippets/hidden-docs-notice.md
:::

In this tutorial, you use {{context-engine}} to create reusable context from data already stored in {{es}}. You create an AI index, add a source, generate a Knowledge Indicator, and test it with an {{agent-builder}} agent. You can use your own data or the {{kib}} sample ecommerce data.

## Tutorial outcome

The result is an AI index containing one Knowledge Indicator about a dataset you select.

A Knowledge Indicator (KI) is a document generated from source data, stored in an AI index, and retrieved as context by agents to help answer questions. A KI can contain distilled findings, explanations of how to interpret the data, limitations, and verified {{esql}} queries for retrieving current information from the source.

An automation generates and refreshes the KI. In {{context-engine}}, an automation is implemented as an [Elastic Workflow](/explore-analyze/workflows.md).

## Before you begin

You need:

- An {{stack}} 9.6 deployment with an Enterprise license, or an {{serverless-full}} project.
- Permission to change Advanced Settings in the current Kibana space.
- Permission to [create and run Workflows](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/setup.md) and manage {{context-engine}} AI indices.
- Elasticsearch data that you can read. If you do not have suitable data, install the [**Sample eCommerce orders** data](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/sample-data#add-sample-data-sets), which creates the `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce` index.

Starting with existing data matters. An AI index does not ingest source data by itself. Its sources identify the data that an automation can use to generate KIs.

## 1. Enable {{context-engine}}

Turn on {{context-engine}} for the current Kibana space:

1. In Kibana, open **Stack Management → Advanced Settings**.
2. Search for **{{context-engine}}**.
3. Turn on **{{context-engine}}** (`contextEngine:enabled`).
4. Open **Context** from the Kibana navigation.

This setting applies to the current Kibana space.

## 2. Create an AI index [context-engine-create-ai-index]

An AI index stores KIs for a particular purpose. Its name and description also help agents decide whether it is relevant to a question.

Create the AI index:

1. Select **Create AI Index**.
2. Enter a name that identifies the knowledge the AI index will contain. For example, enter `ecommerce-orders` if you are using the sample data.
3. Add a description that identifies the data and the questions it should support. For example:

   > Context about [your data], including [the important subjects and questions] and tested ESQL for retrieving current details.

4. Select **Index** as the storage type.
4. Select **Create AI index**.

The AI index initially has no sources, automations, or KIs. You must add a source before you can create an automation.

## 3. Add the source data

An ESQL source gives {{context-engine}} data to inspect when it suggests an automation. Start with a small, current sample so that you can review the resulting KI before expanding its coverage.

Add an ESQL source to the AI index:

1. In **Sources**, select **Edit**.
2. On the **Elasticsearch data** tab, expand **Advanced: ES|QL**, then enter a query that returns a small, representative set of records from your data. If you are using the ecommerce sample data, enter:

   ```esql
   FROM kibana_sample_data_ecommerce
   | SORT order_date DESC
   | LIMIT 100
   ```

3. Select **Add ES|QL source**.
4. Confirm that the query appears under **Selected sources**.
5. Select **Save**.

This source gives {{context-engine}} the 100 newest orders as a grounding sample. If you use your own data, change the index, sort field, filters, and limit to select representative records.

The generated Workflow can also inspect the mapping and run aggregations over the underlying index. Review those queries before you run the automation, and distinguish sampled observations from full-dataset findings.

An AI index can have multiple ESQL and connector sources. Keep this first example narrow so that you can inspect the generated KI before expanding its coverage.

## 4. Ask Agent Builder to suggest an automation

Use the guided route for this tutorial:

1. In **Automations**, select **Suggest automation**.
2. Agent Builder opens a conversation with a pre-filled message based on the AI index and its configured source.
3. Send the pre-filled message to start the suggestion.
4. Ask it to create one `index_metadata` KI that:

   - Explains the purpose and limitations of the dataset
   - Records useful interpretations of its important entities, measures, and dimensions
   - Includes verified {{esql}} for common questions about the data
   - Uses a stable ID so later runs update the KI instead of creating duplicates
   - Validates its {{esql}} before writing the KI

5. Review the proposed plan before confirming it.

The proposal should identify the source result it will analyze, the KI it will produce, the access patterns it will generate, and any limits introduced by the source query. It should also identify any additional mapping, sampling, or aggregation queries it plans to run against the underlying data.

For a new AI index, {{agent-builder}} might recommend an Index/Table Metadata automation first. This automation creates an `index_metadata` KI that describes what the data contains, when to use it, and how to query it.

:::{note}
**Create automation** is the manual route. It opens a new, disabled Workflow in the [Workflows YAML editor](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/use-yaml-editor.md) with a manual trigger and generic starter YAML. Use it when you intend to author the KI-generation Workflow yourself.
:::

## 5. Create the automation

Create and review the suggested automation:

1. Confirm the proposed plan, then let {{agent-builder}} build and pilot the Workflow.
2. Review the pilot summary and KI content in the conversation.
3. Confirm that the proposed Workflow uses the intended data, creates one `index_metadata` KI, distinguishes sampled observations from full-dataset findings, and validates its generated ESQL.
4. Tell {{agent-builder}} to save the automation.

You do not need to understand every line of the generated YAML. The pilot KI is temporary, and {{agent-builder}} might delete it before the saved automation runs.

## 6. Run the automation and inspect the KI

Run the saved automation and inspect its output:

1. If {{agent-builder}} did not start the Workflow after saving it, ask it to run the automation. You can also [run it from the Workflows page](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/manage-workflows.md#workflow-run).
2. [Check the execution](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/monitor-workflows.md) and confirm that it completes successfully.
3. Return to the AI index in **Context**, then open **Knowledge Indicators**.
4. Confirm that it contains one `index_metadata` KI that describes the intended data, its limitations, and verified ESQL for querying the source.

For a detailed review process, refer to [Evaluate and improve Knowledge Indicators](evaluate-and-improve-knowledge-indicators.md).

## 7. Make the AI index available to an agent

Add the populated AI index to an Agent Builder agent:

1. Open **Agent Builder**.
2. Create an agent or edit an existing one.
3. In **AI Indices**, add the AI index under **Additional indices**.
4. Save the agent.

The assignment makes the AI index and the dedicated {{context-engine}} retrieval tools available to the agent. Its name and description help the agent decide when to retrieve its KIs. For details about the tools, source-data access, and custom instructions, refer to [Use {{context-engine}} with {{agent-builder}}](use-context-engine-with-agent-builder.md).

## 8. Test how the agent uses the KI

Ask the agent questions that exercise both kinds of context:

1. Ask a question the KI can answer from its distilled content, such as what the dataset represents and what its important limitations are.
2. Ask for current or detailed information that requires one of the KI's verified ESQL queries.

For the ecommerce sample data, ask which questions the index cannot answer, then ask for a current revenue breakdown by manufacturer. The first answer should come from the KI. The second should cause the agent to query the source data.

Confirm that the agent:

- Selects the relevant AI index
- Retrieves the KI as context
- Answers directly when the KI contains the required knowledge
- Uses targeted {{esql}} against the source when current detail is required

KIs can reduce the time and model tokens agents spend exploring source data. They provide reusable knowledge and tested query guidance while preserving access to current source data.

## 9. Test refresh behavior

Run the automation again to confirm that it refreshes the existing KI:

1. Run the automation again.
2. Return to **Knowledge Indicators**.
3. Confirm that the existing KI was updated and that a duplicate was not created.
4. Compare the KI's `updated_at` value and provenance run ID with the previous run.
5. When the output is satisfactory, add an appropriate [scheduled trigger](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/scheduled-triggers.md) to the Workflow.

Choose a production schedule based on how quickly the source changes and how current the generated context must be.

## Next steps

After completing this tutorial, you can:

- Expand or revise the source query after validating the initial KI.
- Add connector sources for data that is not already in Elasticsearch.
- Select another [KI generation strategy](concepts.md#knowledge-indicators) for specific subjects, such as cumulative product or customer profiles.
- [Evaluate and improve the generated KIs](evaluate-and-improve-knowledge-indicators.md) as their sources and intended uses change.
- [Use the AI index with another agent](use-context-engine-with-agents.md).
