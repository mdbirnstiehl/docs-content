# Control access to cases [setup-cases]

To manage cases, users need the appropriate {{kib}} feature privileges. You can grant different levels of access depending on what users need to do, from full control over cases to view-only access.

## Create custom roles for cases [create-custom-roles]

To grant users the appropriate case privileges, create a custom role with the required {{kib}} feature privileges.

::::{applies-switch}

:::{applies-item} stack: ga
1. Go to the **Roles** management page in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Click **Create role**.
3. Enter a role name and (optional) description.
4. Under **{{kib}} privileges**, click **Add {{kib}} privilege**.
5. Select the appropriate spaces or **All Spaces** and expand the feature privileges for **Cases** under your solution (**Management**, **Security**, or **{{observability}}**).
6. Set the privilege level (`All`, `Read`, or `None`) and customize sub-feature privileges as needed.
7. Click **Create role**.
