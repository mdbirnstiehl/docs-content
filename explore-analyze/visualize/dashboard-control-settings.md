# Dashboard control settings [dashboard-control-settings]

This page describes the settings you can configure for dashboard controls. The settings available depend on the [control type](dashboard-controls.md#control-types).

## Options list and range slider settings [options-list-range-slider-settings]

Options lists and range sliders share most settings. A few are specific to one type: **Selections**, **Searching**, and **Ignore timeout for results** apply only to options lists, and **Step size** applies only to range sliders.

### Control settings [data-control-settings]

Set these in the control's editor: when you add the control, or later by hovering over the control and selecting **Edit**.

**Label**
:   Overwrite the default field name with a clearer label.

**Selections**
:   Options list only. Let viewers select multiple values (default), or restrict them to a single value where a new selection replaces the previous one.

**Searching**
:   Options list only. For text and IP address fields, how the search matches values: **Contains** (default for text, and text only), **Prefix** (default for IP address), or **Exact**. Searches aren't case sensitive.

**Step size**
:   Range slider only. Set the slider's step granularity. The smaller the step size, the more steps the slider has.

**Use global filters**
:   Whether the control's available options honor the dashboard's global filters, query, and time range, including the selections in other controls ([chaining](dashboard-controls.md#controls-chaining)). Turn it off to always offer all values, independent of the rest of the dashboard. On by default.

    {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` In these versions, this behavior is set once for the whole dashboard, not per control, as three separate toggles: **Chain controls**, **Apply global filters to controls**, and **Apply global time range to controls**. Open the control settings dialog with **Add** → **Controls** → **Settings**. In 9.0 and 9.1, select **Controls** → **Settings** instead.

**Validate user selections**
:   Flag a selected value that returns no data once the dashboard's other filters and control selections are applied, so viewers can tell the selection is empty. On by default.

    {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` In these versions, this is set once for the whole dashboard in the same control settings dialog, applying to all controls.

**Ignore timeout for results**
:   Options list only. Wait to display results until the list is complete. Useful for large data sets, but the results might take longer to populate.

### Display settings [data-display-settings]

Display settings apply to pinned controls: hover over the control and select {icon}`gear` **Display settings**. Resize an unpinned control by dragging it, like any other panel.

**Minimum width**
:   Set the control's minimum width. To let the control grow beyond it and fill the available space, turn on **Expand width to fit available space**.

    {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` In these versions, set the minimum width and expand option in the control's own settings.

### Dashboard settings [data-dashboard-settings]

In **Edit** mode, select **Settings** in the application menu, then find the **Control panels** section.

**Auto apply filters** or **Apply selections automatically**
:   Choose whether the dashboard updates as soon as a selection is made, or only when you select **Apply**. Applies to all controls. Updates automatically by default.

    {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` In these versions, this is set in the control settings dialog, opened with **Add** → **Controls** → **Settings**. In 9.0 and 9.1, select **Controls** → **Settings** instead.

## Variable control settings [variable-control-settings]
```{applies_to}
serverless: preview
stack: preview 9.0
```

[Variable controls](add-variable-controls.md) get their values, variable name, and type when you create them. After that, these settings are available.

### Control settings [variable-editor-settings]

Set these in the control's editor: when you add the control, or later by hovering over the control and selecting **Edit**.

**Label**
:   Overwrite the default variable name with a clearer label.

**Selections** {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3`
:   Let viewers select a single value (default) or multiple values.

### Display settings [variable-display-settings]

Display settings apply to pinned controls: hover over the control and select {icon}`gear` **Display settings**. Resize an unpinned control by dragging it, like any other panel.

**Minimum width**
:   Set the control's minimum width. To let the control grow beyond it and fill the available space, turn on **Expand width to fit available space**.

    {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.0-9.3` In these versions, set the minimum width and expand option in the control's own settings.

Variable controls chain by referencing another control's variable in their {{esql}} query, not through a setting. For details, refer to [Chain variable controls](add-variable-controls.md#chain-variable-controls).

## Time slider settings [time-slider-settings]

A [time slider](add-time-slider-controls.md) has no field or value settings to configure. Its range comes from the dashboard's [global time range](../query-filter/filtering.md), and you can pin the start of the range so it stays fixed while the end extends. For details, refer to [Add a time slider control](add-time-slider-controls.md).
