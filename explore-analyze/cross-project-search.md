# {{cps-cap}} [cross-project-search]

**{{cps-cap}}** ({{cps-init}}) enables you to run a single search request across multiple {{serverless-short}} projects.
When your data is split across projects to organize ownership, use cases, or environments, {{cps}} lets you query all that data from a single place, without having to search each project individually.

{{cps-cap}} relies on linking projects within your {{ecloud}} organization. After you link projects together, searches from the origin project automatically run across all linked projects.

This overview explains how {{cps}} works, including project linking and security.
For details on how search, tags, and project routing work in {{cps-init}}, refer to the following pages:

* [Link projects for {{cps}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-link-projects.md): step-by-step instructions for linking projects in the {{ecloud}} UI.
* [Search in {{cps-init}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-search.md): learn how search expressions, search options, and index resolution work.
* [Tags in {{cps-init}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-tags.md): learn about predefined and custom project tags and how to use them in queries.
* [Project routing in {{cps-init}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-project-routing.md): learn how to route searches to specific projects based on tag values.

## {{cps-cap}} as the default behavior for linked projects

Projects are intended to act as logical namespaces for data, not hard boundaries for querying it. You can split data into projects to organize ownership, use cases, or environments, while still expecting to search and analyze that data from a single place.

Because of this, after you link additional projects to your current (_origin_) project, all searches from the origin project query every linked project by default.
Searches are designed to run across projects automatically, providing the same experience for querying, analysis, and insights across projects as within a single project.
Restricting search scope is always possible, but it requires explicitly scoping the search request using [qualified expressions](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-search.md#search-expressions) or [routing parameters](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-project-routing.md).

## Project linking

In {{serverless-short}}, projects can be linked together. The project from which links are created is called the origin project, and the connected projects are referred to as linked projects.

The **origin project** is the project you are currently working in and from which you run cross-project searches.
**Linked projects** are other projects that are connected to the origin project and whose data can be searched from it.

After you link projects, searches that you run from the origin project are no longer local to the origin project by default.
**Any search initiated on the origin project automatically runs across the origin project and all its linked projects ({{cps}}).**

When you search from an origin project, the query runs against its linked projects automatically unless you explicitly change the query scope by using [project routing expressions](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-project-routing.md) or [qualified index expressions](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-search.md#search-expressions).

Project linking is not bidirectional. Searches initiated from a linked project do not run against the origin project.

You can link projects by using the {{ecloud}} UI. For step-by-step instructions, refer to [Link projects for {{cps}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-link-projects.md).

### Project ID and aliases

Each project has a unique project ID and a project alias.
The project alias is derived from the project name and can be modified.

The **project ID** uniquely identifies a project and is system-generated.

The [**project alias**](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md#elasticsearch-manage-project-connection-aliases) is a human-readable identifier derived from the project's connection alias. If you want to change the project alias, you must update the connection alias of the linked project.

While both the project ID and project alias uniquely identify a project, {{cps}} uses project aliases in index expressions. Project aliases are intended to be user-friendly and descriptive, making search expressions easier to read and maintain.

#### Referencing the origin project

In addition to using a project alias, {{cps-init}} provides a reserved identifier, `_origin`, that always refers to the origin project of the search.
You can use `_origin` in search expressions to explicitly target the origin project, without having to reference its specific project alias. Refer to [Qualified and unqualified search expressions](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-search.md#search-expressions) for detailed examples and to learn more.

## Security

This section gives you a high-level overview of how security works in {{cps}}.
<!-- Refer to the [CPS Security]() section to learn in greater detail. -->

In {{cps-init}}, access to a project's data is determined by the [roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/user-roles.md) assigned to you in that project. Your access does not change based on how you perform a search: whether you query directly within a project or access it through {{cps}}, the same permissions apply.

::::{note}
{{cps-cap}} is not available when performing programmatic searches using {{es}} API keys, since they're project-scoped and they return results from the local project only.
::::
<!-- Link to universal API keys. -->

Access control operates in two stages:

* Authentication verifies the identity associated with a request (for example, a Cloud user or API key) and retrieves that identity's role assignments in each project.
* Authorization evaluates those roles to determine which actions and resources the request can access within each project.

For example, if you have a viewer role in project 1, an admin role in project 2, and a custom role in project 3, you can access all three projects through {{cps}}. Each project enforces the permissions associated with the role you have in that project.

When a {{cps}} query targets a linked project that you have access to, authorization checks are performed locally in that project to determine whether you have the required privileges to access the requested resources.

**Example**
You have read access to the `logs` index in project 1, but no access to the `logs` index in project 2.
If you run `GET logs/_search`:

* documents from the `logs` index in project 1 are returned
* the `logs` index in project 2 is not accessible and is excluded from the results
