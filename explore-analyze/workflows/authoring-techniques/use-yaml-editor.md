# Use the YAML editor [workflows-yaml-editor]

The YAML editor is where you author, refine, and run workflow definitions in {{kib}}. You can write YAML yourself, or start from a [natural language description](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/use-natural-language.md) and edit the generated definition here.

::::{admonition} Requirements
To use workflows, you must turn on the feature and ensure your role has the appropriate privileges. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/setup.md) for more information.

You must also have the appropriate subscription. Refer to the subscription page for [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud) and [Elastic Stack/self-managed](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) for the breakdown of available features and their associated subscription tiers.

## Editor layout [workflows-editor-layout]

The editor layout is composed of the following elements:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Editor pane** | The main area for writing and editing workflows. To learn more about the expected workflow structure, refer to [](/explore-analyze/workflows.md). |
| **Actions menu** | A quick-add menu for pre-formatted [triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers.md) and [step types](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps.md). Built-in triggers (`manual`, `scheduled`, and `alert`) appear at the top level. <br> {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` Event-driven triggers are grouped by family when a family has more than one trigger, so related triggers such as the cases triggers appear together under a **Cases** group. |
| **Save button** | Saves the current workflow. |
| **Run button** | Manually runs the entire workflow or an individual step. <br> - Entire workflow: Click the **Run** icon {icon}`play` (next to **Save**).  <br> - Individual step: Select the step in the editor pane, then click the **Run** icon {icon}`play`.   |
| **Executions tab** | Shows [execution history](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/monitor-workflows.md) and real-time logs. |
| **Validation logs** | Shows validation successes and failures. Some common validation errors include: <br> - Invalid YAML syntax because of incorrect indentation or formatting <br> - Missing a required field or property (for example, `name`, `type`) <br> - The step type is unknown or doesn't match a valid action <br> - Invalid template syntax because of malformed template expression.|

:::{tip}
When viewing step output in the executions panel, click the **Copy** icon next to a step name to copy its full output path to your clipboard. For example, clicking **Copy** on a step named `check_if_newer` copies `steps.check_if_newer.output.conditionResult`, which you can paste directly into your workflow YAML to reference that step's output.

## Test runs and production runs [workflows-test-vs-production-runs]

Every workflow execution is either a test run or a production run. Understanding the difference helps you iterate safely during development without affecting real processes.

| | Test run {icon}`flask` | Production run {icon}`play` |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Try out a workflow or individual step while authoring | Run an enabled workflow for real |
| **How to start** | Click **Run** {icon}`play` in the workflow editor. Refer to [Provide data for a test run](#workflows-supply-test-input) for more information. | Click **Run** from the workflow list, or let a configured trigger fire. |
| **Scope** | Entire workflow or a single step | Entire workflow |
| **Execution history** | Saved with a flask ({icon}`flask`) badge so you can filter for test runs. Step-level test runs are not saved in history. ![Alt text](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-test-runs.png "=700x600") | Saved without a badge. Filter the executions list by **production** to see only these runs. ![Alt text](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-filter-prod-runs.png "=700x600") |
| **Template context** | `execution.isTestRun` resolves to `true`. | `execution.isTestRun` resolves to `false`. |

You can use the `execution.isTestRun` context variable in your workflow YAML to change behavior during testing. For example, you can choose to skip sending a real notification during a test run.

## Provide data for a test run [workflows-supply-test-input]

When you click **Run** {icon}`play` in the editor, the **Test workflow** dialog asks what data to run the workflow against. Which options appear depends on the workflow's triggers. Common options include:

- **Document**: Use a real document from {{es}}. Appears when the workflow has a [manual trigger](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/manual-triggers.md).
- **Manual**: Type your own JSON.
- **Historical**: Reuse the data from a previous run. {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`

For [event-driven](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/event-driven-triggers.md) workflows, the dialog also includes an **Event** tab where you can pick a real event to test against. Refer to [Test a workflow with a real event](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/event-driven-triggers.md#event-driven-triggers-test). {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`

For [alert-triggered](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/alert-triggers.md) workflows, the dialog includes an **Alert** tab where you can pick a real alert to test against.

### Use a document from {{es}} [workflows-supply-test-input-document]

Select **Document**, then search for and pick a document from an {{es}} index. The workflow runs against that document's actual field values, which is useful for confirming your steps behave correctly with real data before you rely on a live trigger.

### Type your own JSON [workflows-supply-test-input-manual]

Select **Manual**, then enter JSON directly in the dialog. This is useful for testing a specific scenario, such as an edge case or a field value that's hard to find in your existing data.

### Reuse data from a previous run [workflows-supply-test-input-historical]

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.5+
serverless: ga
```

Select **Historical**, then, under **Select execution**, search or pick a previous run from the list. A time-range filter next to the picker defaults to the last week, so you can narrow a long execution history down to the runs you care about.

After a run from the editor finishes, click the **Run again** icon {icon}`refresh` next to **Done** in the execution panel. The **Test workflow** dialog opens on the **Historical** tab with that run selected. The time range uses the execution's start time as the end of the range and a start one week earlier, so the selected run stays in the list.

If you select a run from the **Executions** tab, click **Run** in the editor and select **Historical**.

If you change the time range so the selected execution falls outside it, the selection clears and **Run** stays unavailable until you pick another execution.

After you select an execution, click **Run** to start a test run using that execution's data.

Reusing data this way is useful when you want to reproduce an issue or validate a workflow change against real data from a prior run, without tracking down the original event or re-entering values by hand.
