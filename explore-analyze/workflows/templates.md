# Workflow templates [workflows-templates]

Workflow templates are pre-built workflows that you can use as a starting point. Instead of building automations from scratch, pick a template and customize it to fit your needs. For example, templates are useful for:
- Automating a common task
- Learning how workflows work
- Saving time with a ready-made example of a common automation pattern

## Access templates [workflows-templates-access]

[Browse](https://github.com/elastic/workflows/) available templates and examples to find one that matches your use case. Refer to the readme to get started using templates.
