# Event-driven triggers [workflows-event-driven-triggers]

Event-driven triggers let workflows react to events elsewhere in {{kib}}. The following trigger families are available:

- **`workflows.failed`** — Fires when another workflow's execution fails. {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
- **Cases triggers** — Fire when cases change (created, updated, status changed, attachments added, comments added). {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
- **Alert episode lifecycle triggers** — Fire on specific alert episode events in the {{alerting-v2-system}}, such as when it is activated, assigned, acknowledged, or snoozed. {applies_to}`stack: experimental 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: experimental`
- **{{alerting-v2-system-cap}} rule lifecycle triggers** — Fire when rules are created, updated, deleted, enabled, or disabled in the {{alerting-v2-system}}. {applies_to}`stack: experimental 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: experimental`

:::{warning}
The event-driven trigger system is in technical preview, including the triggers documented on this page. The schema and semantics can change in future releases.

## `workflows.failed`

Fires when any workflow execution reaches the `failed` terminal state. Use this trigger to build handler workflows that react to failures in your production workflows, for example by paging on-call, opening a case, or logging to a dedicated index for observability.

### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `workflows.failed`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. The trigger fires only when the condition matches. |

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
```

### Filter the events that fire the trigger

Use `on.condition` to narrow which failed executions trigger the handler. The value is a KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload.

Fire only on failures from a specific workflow:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.name : 'ops--rollback-deployment'"
```

Ignore failures that came from another error handler:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : false"
```

Combine conditions with KQL's `and` to filter on multiple fields:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : false and event.workflow.spaceId : 'production'"
```

### Event payload

When a failed workflow triggers your handler, the handler runs with an `event` context that describes the failure. The payload has four groups: `workflow`, `execution`, `error`, and the top-level `timestamp` and `spaceId`.

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.spaceId` | The {{kib}} space where the failure occurred. |
| `event.timestamp` | ISO timestamp of when the event fired. |
| `event.workflow.id` | The failed workflow's ID. |
| `event.workflow.name` | The failed workflow's name. |
| `event.workflow.spaceId` | The {{kib}} space where the failed workflow ran. |
| `event.workflow.isErrorHandler` | `true` if the failed workflow was itself an error handler. Use this to prevent cascading handler loops. |
| `event.execution.id` | The failed execution's ID. |
| `event.execution.startedAt` | ISO timestamp of when the execution started. |
| `event.execution.failedAt` | ISO timestamp of when the execution failed. |
| `event.error.message` | The error message. |
| `event.error.stepId` | Identifier of the step where the failure occurred, when available. |
| `event.error.stepName` | Name of the step where the failure occurred, when available. |
| `event.error.stepExecutionId` | ID of the step execution where the failure occurred, when available. |

Reference these fields with Liquid templating inside the handler:

```yaml
- name: log_failure
  type: console
  with:
    message: |
      Workflow {{ event.workflow.name }} (id: {{ event.workflow.id }}) failed
      at step {{ event.error.stepName }}: {{ event.error.message }}
```

## Example: Page on-call when a critical workflow fails

```yaml
name: handle-critical-workflow-failures
description: Page on-call and open a case whenever a critical workflow fails.
enabled: true

triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed

steps:
  - name: skip_if_handler
    type: if
    condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : true"
    steps:
      - name: no_op
        type: console
        with:
          message: "Skipping: the failure came from another error handler."

  - name: page_oncall
    if: "not event.workflow.isErrorHandler"
    type: pagerduty.triggerIncident
    connector-id: "platform-pagerduty"
    with:
      dedup_key: "{{ event.workflow.id }}-{{ event.execution.id }}"
      summary: "Workflow {{ event.workflow.name }} failed"
      severity: "critical"
      details:
        failed_step: "{{ event.error.stepName }}"
        error: "{{ event.error.message }}"
        workflow_id: "{{ event.workflow.id }}"
        execution_id: "{{ event.execution.id }}"

  - name: open_case
    if: "not event.workflow.isErrorHandler"
    type: cases.createCase
    with:
      title: "[Auto] Workflow failure: {{ event.workflow.name }}"
      description: |
        Step `{{ event.error.stepName }}` failed.

        Error: `{{ event.error.message }}`
      severity: "high"
      tags: ["workflow-failure", "auto-triage"]
```

## Cases triggers

```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.5+
serverless: preview
```

Cases triggers fire when cases change. Use them to react to case lifecycle events without polling the Cases API.

**Shared payload.** Every cases trigger event includes:

- `event.caseId` — The case ID, the alphanumeric identifier that is unique to each case.
- `event.owner` — The solution that owns the case. It can be `securitySolution` for {{elastic-sec}} cases, `observability` for {{observability}} cases, or `cases` for Stack cases.

Use `event.owner` in `on.condition` to filter by solution. For example, a workflow that only fires for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseCreated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

Individual trigger sections below document any additional payload fields specific to that event.

### `cases.caseCreated` [cases-casecreated-trigger]

Fires when a case is created.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseCreated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The new case's ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |

#### Example

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseCreated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

### `cases.caseUpdated` [cases-caseupdated-trigger]

Fires when a case is updated. The `event.updatedFields` array lists which fields changed.

This trigger also fires when a case's status changes; the dedicated [`cases.caseStatusUpdated`](#cases-casestatusupdated-trigger) trigger fires alongside it and carries the previous status for easier filtering. For bulk updates, `cases.caseUpdated` fires once per case.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseUpdated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The updated case's ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.updatedFields` | Array of field names that changed in this update. |

#### Example

Fire when a {{elastic-sec}} case's title changes:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseUpdated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution" and event.updatedFields: "title"'
```

### `cases.caseStatusUpdated` [cases-casestatusupdated-trigger]

Fires when a case's status changes.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseStatusUpdated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.previousStatus` | The previous status (`open`, `in-progress`, or `closed`). |
| `event.status` | The current status (`open`, `in-progress`, or `closed`). |

#### Example

Fire when a {{elastic-sec}} case is closed:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseStatusUpdated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution" and event.status: "closed"'
```

### `cases.attachmentsAdded` [cases-attachmentsadded-trigger]

Fires when attachments are added to a case. If attachments of multiple types are added in one operation (for example, three alerts and two comments), the trigger fires once per type, with one event for each type.

Adding a comment fires both this trigger (with `event.attachmentType: "comment"`) and the dedicated [`cases.commentsAdded`](#cases-commentsadded-trigger) trigger. Both exist because users don't always think of comments as attachments.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.attachmentsAdded`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.attachmentIds` | Array of attachment IDs added in this operation, all of `event.attachmentType`. |
| `event.attachmentType` | The type of attachments added, for example `"comment"` or `"alert"`. |

#### Examples

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.attachmentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

Fire only when a comment-type attachment is added:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.attachmentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.attachmentType: "comment"'
```

### `cases.commentsAdded` [cases-commentsadded-trigger]

Fires when comments are added to a case.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.commentsAdded`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.commentIds` | Array of comment IDs added in this operation. |

#### Example

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.commentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

## {{alerting-v2-system-cap}} alert episode lifecycle triggers [alert-episode-lifecycle-triggers-event-driven]

```{applies_to}
stack: experimental 9.5+
serverless: experimental
```

Alert episode lifecycle triggers fire on specific alert episode events in the {{alerting-v2-system}}. Unlike `workflows.failed` and cases triggers, they are not configured through a `triggers` block in your workflow YAML. They are emitted by the alerting system and automatically invoke any workflow attached to the matching trigger type. Each trigger fires exactly once per event. There is no polling interval or frequency gate.

### Available triggers [alert-episode-lifecycle-triggers-available]

| Trigger ID | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `alerting.episodeActivated` | An alert episode transitions to the active state. |
| `alerting.episodeDeactivated` | An alert episode is manually deactivated or recovers. |
| `alerting.episodeSnoozed` | An alert episode is snoozed. |
| `alerting.episodeUnsnoozed` | An alert episode is unsnoozed. |
| `alerting.episodeAcked` | An alert episode is acknowledged. |
| `alerting.episodeUnacked` | An alert episode acknowledgment is removed. |
| `alerting.episodeAssigned` | An alert episode is assigned to a user. |
| `alerting.episodeUnassigned` | An alert episode assignment is removed. |
| `alerting.episodeTagged` | A tag is applied to an alert episode. |

### Event payload [alert-episode-lifecycle-triggers-event]

All lifecycle triggers include these common fields in the event payload.

| `event.*` field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.episodeId` | Unique identifier of the alert episode. |
| `event.ruleId` | ID of the rule that produced the alert episode. |
| `event.spaceId` | ID of the {{kib}} space where the event occurred. |

Reference these fields with Liquid templating in workflow steps:

```yaml
- name: log
  type: console
  with:
    message: |
      Episode {{ event.episodeId }} from rule {{ event.ruleId }} changed state.
```

Use these fields to write workflow conditions that scope the automation to specific rules or episodes. For example, use `event.ruleId: "my-rule-id"` to scope the workflow to alert episodes from a specific rule.

## {{alerting-v2-system-cap}} rule lifecycle triggers [alerting-rule-lifecycle-triggers-event-driven]

```{applies_to}
stack: experimental 9.5+
serverless: experimental
```

{{alerting-v2-system-cap}} rule lifecycle triggers fire when rules are created, updated, deleted, enabled, or disabled in the {{alerting-v2-system}}. Use them to automate responses to rule management actions, for example, auditing rule changes, syncing rule inventory with an external CMDB, or notifying a team channel when a new rule is added to a space.

Rule lifecycle triggers are part of the {{alerting-v2-system}} and fire independently of alert episodes.

### Available triggers [alerting-rule-lifecycle-triggers-available]

| Trigger ID | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `alerting.ruleCreated` | A rule is created. |
| `alerting.ruleUpdated` | A rule's configuration is changed using a `PATCH` or `PUT` update. Enabling or disabling a rule through the dedicated enable or disable action does not emit this trigger. It emits `alerting.ruleEnabled` or `alerting.ruleDisabled` instead. |
| `alerting.ruleDeleted` | A rule is deleted. |
| `alerting.ruleEnabled` | A rule is enabled. |
| `alerting.ruleDisabled` | A rule is disabled. |

For bulk operations (bulk enable, bulk disable, bulk delete), one trigger event is emitted for each affected rule.

### Schema [alerting-rule-lifecycle-triggers-schema]

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | One of: `alerting.ruleCreated`, `alerting.ruleUpdated`, `alerting.ruleDeleted`, `alerting.ruleEnabled`, `alerting.ruleDisabled`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. The trigger fires only when the condition matches. |

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: alerting.ruleCreated
  - type: alerting.ruleUpdated
  - type: alerting.ruleDeleted
  - type: alerting.ruleEnabled
  - type: alerting.ruleDisabled
```

### Event payload [alerting-rule-lifecycle-triggers-event]

All rule lifecycle triggers share the same minimal payload.

| `event.*` field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.rule.ruleId` | Unique identifier of the rule that was created, updated, deleted, enabled, or disabled. |
| `event.rule.spaceId` | ID of the {{kib}} space where the operation occurred. |

Reference these fields with Liquid templating in workflow steps:

```yaml
- name: log_rule_event
  type: console
  with:
    message: |
      Rule {{ event.rule.ruleId }} changed in space {{ event.rule.spaceId }}.
```

Use `on.condition` to scope the trigger to a specific rule or space:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: alerting.ruleCreated
    on:
      condition: 'event.rule.spaceId: "production"'
```

### Example: Audit rule changes [alerting-rule-lifecycle-triggers-example]

```yaml
name: audit-rule-changes
description: Log rule lifecycle events across all spaces.
enabled: true

triggers:
  - type: alerting.ruleCreated
  - type: alerting.ruleUpdated
  - type: alerting.ruleDeleted
  - type: alerting.ruleEnabled
  - type: alerting.ruleDisabled

steps:
  - name: log_change
    type: console
    with:
      message: |
        Rule {{ event.rule.ruleId }} in space {{ event.rule.spaceId }} — trigger: {{ trigger.type }}
```

## Prevent cascading handler loops

This section applies to `workflows.failed` handlers. Alert episode lifecycle triggers fire once per event and do not re-trigger on workflow failure.

If a handler workflow itself fails, it can re-trigger itself. Two safeguards help you avoid infinite loops:

- Every event includes `event.workflow.isErrorHandler`, which is `true` when the failing workflow is itself a handler. Filter on this in your handler's logic to skip handling your own failures.
- The execution engine enforces a chain-depth limit on cascading event-driven triggers as a safety net.

In practice, keep handler workflows simpler than the workflows they monitor. A handler that only logs, opens a case, and notifies is less likely to fail than the automation it's handling.
