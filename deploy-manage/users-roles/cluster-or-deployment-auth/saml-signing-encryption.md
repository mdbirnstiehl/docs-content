# Configure SAML signing and encryption [saml-enc-sign]

This page is a detailed reference for SAML signing and encryption configuration. For the complete SAML SSO configuration, refer to [SAML authentication](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md).

The {{stack}} supports generating signed SAML authentication and logout messages, verifying signed messages from the IdP, and processing encrypted content.

You can configure {{es}} for signing, encryption or both, using a single key or individual keys.

The {{stack}} uses X.509 certificates with RSA private keys for SAML cryptography. These keys can be generated using any standard SSL tool, including the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool.

Your IdP might require that the {{stack}} have a cryptographic key for signing SAML messages, and that you provide the corresponding signing certificate in your Service Provider configuration — either in the {{stack}} SAML metadata file, or manually in the IdP administration interface.

While most IdPs do not expect authentication requests to be signed, signatures are often required for logout requests. Your IdP validates these signatures against the signing certificate that is configured for the {{stack}} Service Provider.

Encryption certificates are rarely needed, but the {{stack}} supports them for cases where IdPs or local policies mandate their use.

## Generate certificates and keys [saml-sign-generate-certs]

{{es}} supports certificates and keys in either PEM, PKCS#12 or JKS format. Some Identity Providers are more restrictive in the formats they support, and require you to provide the certificates as a file in a particular format. You should consult the documentation for your IdP to determine what formats they support.

### Example: Using `openssl`

```sh
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -nodes -sha256 -out saml-sign.crt -keyout saml-sign.key
```

### Example: Using `elasticsearch-certutil`

```{applies_to}
deployment:
  self:
```

Using the [`elasticsearch-certutil` tool](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/command-line-tools/certutil.md), you can generate a signing certificate with the following command. Because PEM format is the most commonly supported format, the example generates a certificate in that format.

```sh
bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --self-signed --pem --days 1100 --name saml-sign --out saml-sign.zip
```

This command does the following:

* generate a certificate and key pair (the `cert` subcommand)
* create the files in PEM format (`--pem` option)
* generate a certificate that is valid for 3 years (`--days 1100`)
* name the certificate `saml-sign` (`--name` option)
* save the certificate and key in the `saml-sign.zip` file (`--out` option)

The generated zip archive contains three files:

* `saml-sign.crt`, the public certificate to be used for signing
* `saml-sign.key`, the private key for the certificate
* `ca.crt`, a CA certificate that is not needed, and can be ignored.

Encryption certificates can be generated with the same process.

## Sign outgoing SAML messages [saml-sign-configure]

By default, {{es}} signs *all* outgoing SAML messages if a signing certificate and key has been configured.

:::{include} /deploy-manage/_snippets/es-file-path-tip.md
:::

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} PEM-formatted keys

If you want to use **PEM formatted** keys and certificates for signing, then you should configure the following settings on the SAML realm:

`signing.certificate`
:   The path to the PEM formatted certificate file. for example, `saml/saml-sign.crt`

    :::::{note}
    Only the single leaf certificate is required for the `signing.certificate` setting, even when using an internal or non-public Certificate Authority (CA).
    If additional certificates are included, {{es}} attempts to validate the resulting chain, and the chain must be valid and complete.
    :::::

`signing.key`
:   The path to the PEM formatted key file. for example, `saml/saml-sign.key`

`signing.secure_key_passphrase`
:   The passphrase for the key, if the file is encrypted. This is a secure setting that must be uploaded to your [{{es}} keystore](/deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md).

:::
:::{tab-item} PKCS#12 or Java Keystore
If you want to use **PKCS#12 formatted** files or a **Java Keystore** for signing, then you should configure the following settings on the SAML realm:

`signing.keystore.path`
:   The path to the PKCS#12 or JKS keystore. for example, `saml/saml-sign.p12`

`signing.keystore.alias`
:   The alias of the key within the keystore. for example, `signing-key`

`signing.keystore.secure_password`
:   The passphrase for the keystore, if the file is encrypted. This is a secure setting that must be uploaded to your [{{es}} keystore](/deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md).
:::

### Sign only certain message types

If you want to sign some, but not all outgoing SAML messages, then configure `signing.saml_messages` with a comma separated list of message types to sign. Supported values are `AuthnRequest`, `LogoutRequest` and `LogoutResponse` and the default value is `*`.

For example:

```yaml
xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      realms:
        saml-realm-name:
          order: 2
          ...
          signing.saml_messages: AuthnRequest # <1>
          ...
```

1. This configuration ensures that only SAML authentication requests will be sent signed to the Identity Provider.

## Configure {{es}} for encrypted messages [saml-encryption-configure]

{{es}} supports a single key for message decryption. If a key is configured, then {{es}} attempts to use it to decrypt `EncryptedAssertion` and `EncryptedAttribute` elements in Authentication responses, and `EncryptedID` elements in Logout requests.

{{es}} rejects any SAML message that contains an `EncryptedAssertion` that cannot be decrypted.

If an `Assertion` contains both encrypted and plain-text attributes, then failure to decrypt the encrypted attributes does not cause an automatic rejection. Rather, {{es}} processes the available plain-text attributes (and any `EncryptedAttributes` that could be decrypted).

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} PEM-formatted keys

If you want to use **PEM formatted** keys and certificates for SAML encryption, then you should configure the following settings on the SAML realm:

`encryption.certificate`
:   The path to the PEM formatted certificate file. for example, `saml/saml-crypt.crt`

    :::::{note}
    Only the single leaf certificate is required for the `encryption.certificate` setting, even when using an internal or non-public Certificate Authority (CA).
    If additional certificates are included, {{es}} will attempt to validate the resulting chain, and the chain must be valid and complete.
    :::::

`encryption.key`
:   The path to the PEM formatted key file. for example, `saml/saml-crypt.key`

`encryption.secure_key_passphrase`
:   The passphrase for the key, if the file is encrypted. This is a secure setting that must be uploaded to your [{{es}} keystore](/deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md).

:::
:::{tab-item} PKCS#12 or Java Keystore

If you want to use **PKCS#12 formatted** files or a **Java Keystore** for SAML encryption, then you should configure the following settings on the SAML realm:

`encryption.keystore.path`
:   The path to the PKCS#12 or JKS keystore. for example, `saml/saml-crypt.p12`

`encryption.keystore.alias`
:   The alias of the key within the keystore. for example, `encryption-key`

`encryption.keystore.secure_password`
:   The passphrase for the keystore, if the file is encrypted. This is a secure setting that must be uploaded to your [{{es}} keystore](/deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md).
