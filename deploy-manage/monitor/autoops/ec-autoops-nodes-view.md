# Nodes view in AutoOps [ec-autoops-nodes-view]

The **Nodes** view provides a thorough look into essential metrics for all monitored nodes. With this view, you can gain deeper insight into your cluster's health on a per-node basis and observe each metric over extended periods of time.

Use the dropdowns to select the deployment or cluster and nodes you want to view. For nodes, you can select all, select a group, or choose tier-based grouping.

Use the date and time picker to select a time period for the data shown.

To get to the **Nodes** view, go to AutoOps in your deployment or cluster and select **Nodes** from the side navigation.

## Sections in the Nodes view

The following table lists all the sections in the **Nodes** view that drill down into specific monitoring areas, along with the names and descriptions of metrics they present. 

| Area | Metric name | Metric description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Activity | Indexing rate | Number of documents being indexed per second on all primary and replica shards hosted on the node. |
|  | Indexing latency | Average latency for indexing documents, which is the time it takes to index documents divided by the number that were indexed in all primary and replica shards hosted on the node. |
|  | Search rate | Number of search requests being executed per second on all shards hosted on the node. |
|  | Search latency | Average latency for searching, which is the time it takes to execute searches divided by the number of searches submitted to the node. |
| Host and Process | Load | Load average over the last five minutes showing how many tasks have been waiting for CPU, or are blocked on I/O. <br><br> Comparing the load value to the number of CPU cores on the node indicates the system's capacity:<br><br> - `load` < `number of cores`: the system has spare capacity<br> - `load` = `number of cores`: the system is saturated<br> - `load` > `number of cores`: the system is overloaded |
|  | CPU | Percentage of CPU usage for the {{es}} process running on the node. |
|  | Heap used in bytes | Total JVM heap memory used by the {{es}} process running on the node. |
|  | GC | Average time spent doing garbage collection on the node, in milliseconds. |
| Thread pools | Write | Number of index, delete, and update operations in the queue, as well as the total number of completed and rejected operations in that pool. |
|  | Search | Number of search, count, and fetch operations in the queue, as well as the total number of completed and rejected operations in that pool. |
|  | Management | Number of cluster management operations in the queue, as well as the total number of completed and rejected operations in that pool. |
|  | Snapshot | Number of snapshot and restore operations in the queue, as well as the total number of completed and rejected operations in that pool. |
| Data | Disk usage | Amount of used disk storage on the node. |
|  | Shards count | Total number of primary and replica shards allocated to the node. |
|  | Segments count | Total number of Lucene segments hosted on the node. Segments are the low-level inverted indices that compose an {{es}} index. |
|  | Documents count | Total number of documents hosted on the node. |
| HTTP | HTTP current open | Current number of HTTP connections open on the node. |
|  | HTTP connections open rate | Number of HTTP connections opened per second. |
| Circuit breakers | Parent Used | Estimated memory used for the parent circuit breaker, which tracks the overall heap memory that is necessary for all circuit breakers and prevents {{es}} from exceeding a pre-configured threshold. |
|  | Field Data Used | Estimated memory used for the field data circuit breaker, which tracks the heap memory necessary for holding field data and global ordinals and prevents {{es}} from exceeding a pre-configured threshold. Field data and global ordinals are used to perform aggregations. |
|  | Request Used | Estimated memory used for the request circuit breaker, which tracks the heap memory necessary for holding per-request data structures (e.g., memory used for calculating aggregations during a request) and prevents {{es}} from exceeding a pre-configured threshold. |
|  | Parent Tripped | Total number of times the parent circuit breaker has reached the pre-configured threshold and prevented an out-of-memory error. |
|  | Field Data Tripped | Total number of times the field data breaker has reached the pre-configured threshold and prevented an out-of-memory error. |
|  | Request Tripped | Total number of times the request circuit breaker has reached the pre-configured threshold and prevented an out-of-memory error. |
| Network | Network rx bytes | Size of network packets received by the node during internal cluster communication. |
|  | Network rx count | Total number of network packets received by the node during internal cluster communication. |
|  | Network tx bytes | Size of network packets transmitted by the node during internal cluster communication. |
|  | Network tx count | Total number of network packets transmitted by the node during internal cluster communication. |
| Disk | Disk read bytes | Total number of bytes read across all storage devices used by {{es}}. |
|  | Disk read IOPS | Total number of read operations performed every second across all storage devices used by {{es}}. |
|  | Disk write bytes | Total number of bytes written across all storage devices used by {{es}}. |
|  | Disk write IOPS | Total number of write operations performed every second across all storage devices used by {{es}}. |
| Activity-Additional | Merge rate | Number of merge operations being executed per second on all shards hosted on the node. |
|  | Merge latency | Average latency for merging, which is the time it takes to execute merges divided by the number of merge operations submitted to the node. |
|  | Indexing failed | Number of failed indexing operations on the node. |
|  | Initializing shards | Number of initializing shards on the node. |
