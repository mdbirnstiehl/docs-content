# {{stack}} configuration policies [k8s-stack-config-policy]

::::{warning}
We have identified an issue with {{es}} 8.15.1 and 8.15.2 that prevents security role mappings configured via Stack configuration policies to work correctly. Avoid these versions and upgrade to 8.16+ to remedy this issue if you are affected.
::::


::::{note}
This requires a valid Enterprise license or Enterprise trial license. Check [the license documentation](../../license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md) for more details about managing licenses.
::::

::::{note}
Component templates created in configuration policies cannot currently be referenced from index templates created through the {{es}} API or {{kib}} UI.
::::

Starting from ECK `2.6.1` and {{es}} `8.6.1`, {{stack}} configuration policies allow you to configure the following settings for {{es}}:

* [Cluster Settings](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)
* [Snapshot Repositories](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-snapshot-create-repository)
* [Snapshot Lifecycle Policies](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-slm-put-lifecycle)
* [Ingest pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ingest-put-pipeline)
* [Index Lifecycle Policies](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ilm-put-lifecycle)
* [Index templates](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-index-template)
* [Components templates](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-put-component-template)
* [Role mappings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-put-role-mapping)
* [{{es}} Configuration](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md) (configuration settings for {{es}} that will go into [`elasticsearch.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md)) [ECK 2.11.0]
* [{{es}} Secure Settings](../../security/secure-settings.md) [ECK 2.11.0]
* [Secret Mounts](#k8s-stack-config-policy-specifics-secret-mounts) [ECK 2.11.0]

Additionally with ECK `2.11.0` it is possible to configure {{kib}} as well using {{stack}} configuration policies, the following settings can be configured for {{kib}}:

* [{{kib}} Configuration](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/general-settings.md) (configuration settings for {{kib}} that will go into `kibana.yml`)
* [{{kib}} Secure Settings](../../security/k8s-secure-settings.md)

A policy can be applied to one or more {{es}} clusters or {{kib}} instances in any namespace managed by the ECK operator. Configuration policy settings applied by the ECK operator are immutable through the {{es}} REST API.

With ECK `3.3.0` and later, multiple {{stack}} configuration policies can target the same {{es}} cluster and {{kib}} instance. When multiple policies target the same resource, the policy with the highest `weight` value takes precedence. If multiple policies have the same `weight` value, the operator reports a conflict. 

::::{admonition} Scale considerations

While there is no hard limit on how many `StackConfigPolicy` resources can target the same {{es}} cluster or {{kib}} instance, targeting a single resource with more than 100 policies can increase total reconciliation time to several minutes. For optimal performance, combine related settings into fewer policies rather than creating many granular ones.

Additionally, the total size of settings configured through `StackConfigPolicy` resources for a given {{es}} cluster or {{kib}} instance is limited to 1MB due to Kubernetes secret size constraints.
::::


## Define {{stack}} configuration policies [k8s-stack-config-policy-definition]

{{stack}} configuration policies can be defined in a `StackConfigPolicy` resource. Each `StackConfigPolicy` must have the following field:

* `name` is a unique name used to identify the policy.

At least one of `spec.elasticsearch` or `spec.kibana` needs to be defined with at least one of its attributes.

* `spec.elasticsearch` describes the settings to configure for {{es}}. Each of the following fields except `clusterSettings` is an associative array where keys are arbitrary names and values are definitions:

    * `clusterSettings` are dynamic settings that can be set on a running cluster like with the Cluster Update Settings API.
    * `snapshotRepositories` are snapshot repositories for defining an off-cluster storage location for your snapshots. Check [Specifics for snapshot repositories](#k8s-stack-config-policy-specifics-snap-repo) for more information.
    * `snapshotLifecyclePolicies` are snapshot lifecycle policies, to automatically take snapshots and control how long they are retained.
    * `securityRoleMappings` are role mappings, to define which roles are assigned to each user by identifying them through rules.
    * `ingestPipelines` are ingest pipelines, to perform common transformations on your data before indexing.
    * `indexLifecyclePolicies` are index lifecycle policies, to automatically manage the index lifecycle.
    * `indexTemplates.componentTemplates` are component templates that are building blocks for constructing index templates that specify index mappings, settings, and aliases.
    * `indexTemplates.composableIndexTemplates` are index templates to define settings, mappings, and aliases that can be applied automatically to new indices.
    * `config` are the settings that go into the [`elasticsearch.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md) file.
    * `secretMounts` are the additional user created secrets that need to be mounted to the {{es}} Pods.
    * `secureSettings` is a list of Secrets containing Secure Settings to inject into the keystore(s) of the {{es}} cluster(s) to which this policy applies, similar to the [{{es}} Secure Settings](../../security/secure-settings.md).

* `spec.kibana` describes the settings to configure for {{kib}}.

    * `config` are the settings that go into the [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md) file.
    * `secureSettings` is a list of Secrets containing Secure Settings to inject into the keystore(s) of the {{kib}} instance(s) to which this policy applies, similar to the [{{kib}} Secure Settings](../../security/k8s-secure-settings.md).


The following fields are optional:

* {applies_to}`eck: ga 3.3+` `weight` is an integer that determines the priority of this policy when multiple policies target the same resource. Refer to [Policy priority and weight](#k8s-stack-config-policy-priority-weight) for details.
* `namespace` is the namespace of the `StackConfigPolicy` resource and used to identify the {{es}} clusters and {{kib}} instances to which the policy applies. If it equals to the operator namespace, the policy applies to all namespaces managed by the operator, otherwise the policy only applies to the namespace of the policy.
* `resourceSelector` is a [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to identify the {{es}} clusters and {{kib}} instances to which the policy applies in combination with the namespace(s). No `resourceSelector` means all {{es}} clusters and {{kib}} instances in the namespace(s).

Example of applying a policy that configures snapshot repository, {{slm-init}} Policies, and cluster settings:

```yaml
apiVersion: stackconfigpolicy.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1
kind: StackConfigPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-stack-config-policy
  # namespace: elastic-system or test-namespace
spec:
  weight: 0 <1>
  resourceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: my-label
  elasticsearch:
    clusterSettings:
      indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: "100mb"
    secureSettings:
    - secretName: "my-secure-settings"
    snapshotRepositories:
      test-repo:
        type: gcs
        settings:
          bucket: my-bucket
    snapshotLifecyclePolicies:
      test-slm:
        schedule: "0 1 2 3 4 ?"
        name: "<production-snap-{now/d}>"
        repository: test-repo
        config:
          indices: ["*"]
          ignore_unavailable: true
          include_global_state: false
        retention:
          expire_after: "7d"
          min_count: 1
          max_count: 20
```

```

Multiple `StackConfigPolicy` resources can target the same {{es}} cluster or {{kib}} instance, with `weight` determining which policy takes precedence. Refer to [Policy priority and weight](#k8s-stack-config-policy-priority-weight) for more information.


## Monitor {{stack}} configuration policies [k8s-stack-config-policy-monitoring]

In addition to the logs generated by the operator, a config policy status is maintained in the `StackConfigPolicy` resource. This status gives information in which phase the policy is ("Applying", "Ready", "Error") and it indicates the number of resources for which the policy could be applied.

```sh
kubectl get stackconfigpolicy
```

```sh
NAME                           READY   PHASE   AGE
test-stack-config-policy       1/1     Ready   1m42s
test-err-stack-config-policy   0/1     Error   1m42s
```

When not all resources are ready, you can get more information about the reason by reading the full status:

```sh
kubectl get -n b scp test-err-stack-config-policy -o jsonpath="{.status}" | jq .
```

```json
{
  "errors": 1,
  "observedGeneration": 3,
  "phase": "Error",
  "readyCount": "1/2",
  "resources": 2,
  "details": {
    "elasticsearch": {
      "b/banana-staging": {
        "currentVersion": 1670342369361604600,
        "error": {
          "message": "Error processing slm state change: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error on validating SLM requests\n\tSuppressed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: no such repository [es-snapshots]",
          "version": 1670342482739637500
        },
        "expectedVersion": 1670342482739637500,
        "phase": "Error"
      }
    },
    "kibana": {
      "b/banana-kb-staging": {
        "error": {},
        "phase": "Ready"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Important events are also reported through {{k8s}} events, such as when you don't have the appropriate license:

```sh
17s    Warning   ReconciliationError stackconfigpolicy/config-test   StackConfigPolicy is an enterprise feature. Enterprise features are disabled
```


## Specifics for snapshot repositories [k8s-stack-config-policy-specifics-snap-repo]

In order to avoid a conflict between multiple {{es}} clusters writing their snapshots to the same location, ECK automatically:

* sets the `base_path` to `snapshots/<namespace>-<esName>` when it is not provided, for Azure, GCS and S3 repositories
* appends `<namespace>-<esName>` to `location` for a FS repository
* appends `<namespace>-<esName>` to `path` for an HDFS repository


## Policy priority and weight [k8s-stack-config-policy-priority-weight]
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  eck: ga 3.3+
```

The `weight` field is an integer that determines the priority of a policy when multiple `StackConfigPolicy` resources target the same {{es}} cluster or {{kib}} instance. When multiple policies target the same resource, policies are evaluated in order of their `weight` values (from lowest to highest). Settings from policies with higher `weight` values take precedence and overwrite settings from policies with lower `weight` values. The policy with the highest `weight` value has the highest priority.

The `weight` field is optional and defaults to `0` if not specified. Higher weight values have higher priority.

::::{important} - Conflict resolution

If multiple policies have the same `weight` value and target the same resource, the operator reports a conflict. When a conflict occurs, **no policies are applied to that resource**—this includes not only the conflicting policies but also any other policies that target the same resource. The target resource remains unconfigured by any `StackConfigPolicy` until the conflict is resolved by adjusting the `weight` values of the conflicting policies.
::::

This allows you to create a hierarchy of policies, for example:
* Base policies with lower weights (for example, `weight: 0`) that provide default configurations
* Override policies with higher weights (for example, `weight: 100`) that provide environment-specific or cluster-specific configurations and overwrite the base policy settings

Example of using `weight` to create a policy hierarchy:

```yaml
# Base policy with default settings (lower priority)
apiVersion: stackconfigpolicy.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1
kind: StackConfigPolicy
metadata:
  name: base-policy
spec:
  weight: 0  # Lower weight = lower priority
  resourceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: production
  elasticsearch:
    clusterSettings:
      indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: "50mb"

---
# Override policy with production-specific settings (higher priority)
apiVersion: stackconfigpolicy.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1
kind: StackConfigPolicy
metadata:
  name: production-override-policy
spec:
  weight: 100  # Higher weight = higher priority
  resourceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: production
      tier: critical
  elasticsearch:
    clusterSettings:
      indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: "200mb"
```

In this example, clusters labeled with both `env: production` and `tier: critical` have the `production-override-policy` (weight: 100) settings applied, which overwrite the `base-policy` (weight: 0) settings. Other production clusters use only the `base-policy` (weight: 0) settings.


## Specifics for secret mounts [k8s-stack-config-policy-specifics-secret-mounts]

ECK `2.11.0` introduces `spec.elasticsearch.secretMounts` as a new field. This field allows users to specify a user created secret and a mountPath to indicate where this secret should be mounted in the {{es}} Pods that are managed by the {{stack}} configuration policy. This field can be used to add additional secrets to the {{es}} Pods that may be needed for example for sensitive files required to configure {{es}} security realms. The secret should be created by the user in the same namespace as the {{stack}} configuration policy. The operator reads this secret and copies it over to the namespace of {{es}} so that it can be mounted by the {{es}} Pods. Example of configuring secret mounts in the {{stack}} configuration policy:

```yaml
secretMounts:
  - secretName: jwks-secret <1>
    mountPath: "/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/jwks" <2>
```

1. name of the secret created by the user in the {{stack}} configuration policy namespace.
2. mount path where the secret must be mounted to inside the {{es}} Pod.



## Configuring authentication policies using {{stack}} configuration policy [k8s-stack-config-policy-configuring-authentication-policies]

{{stack}} configuration policy can be used to configure authentication for {{es}} clusters. Check [Managing authentication for multiple stacks using {{stack}} configuration policy](../../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/manage-authentication-for-multiple-clusters.md) for some examples of the various authentication configurations that can be used.
