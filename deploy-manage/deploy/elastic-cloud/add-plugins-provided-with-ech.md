# Add plugins provided with {{ech}} [ec-adding-elastic-plugins]

You can use a variety of [official {{es}} plugins](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch-plugins/index.md) that are compatible with your version of {{es}}. When you upgrade to a new {{es}} version, these plugins are upgraded with the rest of your deployment.

## Before you begin [ec_before_you_begin_6]

Some restrictions apply when adding plugins. For example, plugins are not supported for {{kib}}. To learn more, check [Restrictions for {{es}} and {{kib}} plugins](restrictions-known-problems.md#ec-restrictions-plugins).
