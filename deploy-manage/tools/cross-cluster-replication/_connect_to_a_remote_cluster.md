# Connect to a remote cluster [_connect_to_a_remote_cluster]

Cross-cluster replication (CCR) relies on the [remote clusters](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters.md) feature. Before configuring CCR, ensure that the source cluster (Cluster A) is registered as a remote cluster on the destination cluster (Cluster B).

Connecting to a remote cluster depends on the environment your local and remote clusters are deployed on and the security model you wish to use.

The exact details needed to connect to a remote cluster vary. Select a suitable option for your specific scenario based on the local cluster you're configuring:
