:::{note}
This procedure can be used for both {{ech}} and {{ece}} deployments to register a snapshot repository directly at the deployment level. This is useful when you need a deployment-specific repository that operates independently of the [platform-managed automatic snapshots](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/manage-snapshot-repositories.md#elastic-cloud-hosted) (`found-snapshots`), for example for [searchable snapshots](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/searchable-snapshots.md) or custom backup use cases.

For platform-level repositories configuration in {{ece}}, refer to [Manage snapshot repositories in {{ece}}](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/cloud-enterprise.md).
