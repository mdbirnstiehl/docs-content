Using the Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS) for self-managed clusters (ECE, ECK, or standalone), on-premise or in private cloud environments through Cloud Connect requires a [self-managed Enterprise license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) and self-managed free trials. Note that [EIS pricing](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md#pricing) is usage-based. Using EIS consumes ECUs.
