# FIPS compliance

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140, titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. FIPS 140-2 and its successor FIPS 140-3 define the security requirements that cryptographic modules must meet.

- [{{es}}](/deploy-manage/security/fips-es.md) can run in a JVM configured with a FIPS-certified security provider, and supports the following FIPS compliant modes:
  * FIPS 140-2 
  * {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` FIPS 140-3
- [{{kib}}](/deploy-manage/security/fips-kib.md) offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a Node.js environment configured with a FIPS 140-2 compliant OpenSSL3 provider.
- Some [Ingest tools](/deploy-manage/security/fips-ingest.md), including {{agent}}, {{fleet}}, {{filebeat}}, {{metricbeat}}, and {{apm-server}}, are available as FIPS compatible binaries and can be configured to use FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptography.

:::{note}
If you are running {{es}} through {{eck}}, refer to [ECK FIPS compatibility](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/deploy-fips-compatible-version-of-eck.md).

FIPS compliance is not officially supported in {{ece}} (ECE). While ECE may function on FIPS-enabled systems, this configuration has not been validated through our testing processes and is not recommended for production environments.
