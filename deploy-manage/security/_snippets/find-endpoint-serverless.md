4. In the project overview, under **Application endpoints, cluster and component IDs**, find the application that you want to test.
5. Under **Public endpoint**, you can view your endpoint URL. It looks something like the following:

    ```text subs=true
    https://my-project-d53192.es.{{example-default-dn}}
    ```

In this endpoint, `my-project-d53192` is an alias, and `es` is the product you want to access within your project.
