# Private connectivity with AWS PrivateLink

You can use AWS PrivateLink to establish a secure connection for your {{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects to communicate with other AWS services. AWS routes the PrivateLink traffic within the AWS data center and never exposes it to the public internet.

AWS PrivateLink connects your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to the AWS-hosted services that you use, treating them as if they were in your VPC. You can create and use VPC endpoints to securely access AWS-hosted services.

You can also optionally filter traffic to your deployments or projects by creating virtual private connection (VPC) filters as part of your private connection policy in {{ecloud}}. This limits traffic to your deployment or project to the VPC specified in the policy, as well as any other policies applied to the deployment or project.

To learn how private connection policies impact your deployment or project, refer to [](/deploy-manage/security/network-security-policies.md).

:::{tip}
{{ech}} and {{serverless-full}} also support [IP filters](/deploy-manage/security/ip-filtering-cloud.md). You can apply both IP filters and private connections to a single {{ecloud}} resource.
:::

## Requirements

Serverless projects require the Serverless Plus add-on to apply private connection policies. During the promotional period, applying a private connection policy to a project opts that project in to Serverless Plus. 

:::{tip}
You can opt out by disconnecting all policies from the project.
:::

## Considerations

Before you begin, review  the following considerations:

### Private connections and regions

Private connectivity with AWS PrivateLink is supported only in AWS regions.

AWS interface virtual private connection (VPC) endpoints are configured for one or more availability zones (AZ). In some regions, our VPC endpoint service is not present in all the possible AZs that a region offers. You can only choose AZs that are common on both sides. As the names of AZs (for example `us-east-1a`) differ between AWS accounts, the following list of AWS regions shows the ID (e.g. `use1-az4`) of each available AZ for the service.

Refer to [interface endpoint availability zone considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-availability-zones) for more details.

### Availability zones

::::{applies-switch}
:::{applies-item} ess: ga
Elastic [charges](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/cloud-hosted-deployment-billing-dimensions.md) for inter-node traffic regardless of whether nodes are in the same or different availability zones (AZ). As a result, placing the deployment nodes within a single AZ, instead of two or three, does not reduce inter-node costs.

On the customer VPC side, the inter-availability zone data transfer, within the same AWS region, towards AWS PrivateLink endpoints, [is free of charge](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-data-transfer-price-reduction-privatelink-transit-gateway-client-vpn-services/). As a result, you do not incur charges for cross-AZ data transfer within your VPC when the target is the AWS Privatelink {{ecloud}} service endpoint. We recommend you set up the VPC endpoints in all supported {{ecloud}} AZs for a particular region for maximum traffic throughput and resiliency.

If Elastic and your VPC overlap in two AZs or less, you can create subnets and VPC PrivateLink endpoints in your VPC within the same availability zones where the Elastic PrivateLink service is present.
:::
:::{applies-item} serverless: ga
{{serverless-full}} does not expose availability zones (AZ) to you—you don't choose or see AZs for your project. On the AWS side, however, interface VPC endpoints are still configured for one or more AZs. Inter-availability zone data transfer within the same AWS region toward AWS PrivateLink endpoints [is free of charge](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-data-transfer-price-reduction-privatelink-transit-gateway-client-vpn-services/). We recommend you set up VPC endpoints in all AZs where the {{ecloud}} PrivateLink service is present for your region, for maximum throughput and resiliency.

### Transport client

Transport client is not supported over PrivateLink connections.

## PrivateLink service names and aliases [ec-private-link-service-names-aliases]

Some metadata might differ between {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, even if the region is the same.

## Set up a private connection

The process of setting up a private connection with AWS PrivateLink is split between the AWS console and the {{ecloud}} UI. These are the high-level steps:

| AWS console | {{ecloud}} |
| --- | --- |
| 1. [Create a VPC endpoint using {{ecloud}} service name.](#ec-aws-vpc-dns) |  |
| 2. [Create a DNS record pointing to the VPC endpoint.](#ec-aws-vpc-dns) |  |
|  | 3. **Optional**: [Create a private connection policy.](#ec-add-vpc-elastic)<br><br>A private connection policy is required to filter traffic using the VPC endpoint ID. |
|  | 4. **Optional**: [Associate the private connection policy with deployments or projects](#associate-private-connection-policy). |
|  | 5. [Interact with your deployments or projects over PrivateLink](#ec-access-the-deployment-over-private-link). |

After you create your private connection policy, you can [edit](#edit-private-connection-policy), [disassociate](#remove-private-connection-policy), or [delete](#delete-private-connection-policy) it.

:::{admonition} Private connection policies are optional
Private connection policies are optional for AWS PrivateLink. After the VPC endpoint and DNS record are created, private connectivity is established. You only need to create a private connection policy if you want to filter traffic to your deployment or project using VPC filters.
:::


### Before you begin [ec-aws-vpc-overlapping-azs]

Before you begin, you should ensure your VPC endpoint is in all availability zones supported by {{ecloud}} for the region and resource type. Placing your VPC endpoint in all supported {{ecloud}} availability zones for the region improves throughput and resiliency when connecting over PrivateLink.

For {{ech}} deployments, if your VPC is not in all supported availability zones, traffic can become imbalanced, saturating some coordinating nodes while underutilizing others, which might impact performance.

You can find the zone name to zone ID mapping with AWS CLI:

```sh
$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1 | jq -c '.AvailabilityZones[] | { id: .ZoneId, name: .ZoneName } ' | sort
{"id":"use1-az1","name":"us-east-1c"}
{"id":"use1-az2","name":"us-east-1e"}
{"id":"use1-az3","name":"us-east-1d"}
{"id":"use1-az4","name":"us-east-1a"}
{"id":"use1-az5","name":"us-east-1f"}
{"id":"use1-az6","name":"us-east-1b"}
```

The mapping will be different for your region. Our production VPC Service for `us-east-1` is located in `use1-az2`, `use1-az4`, `use1-az6`. We need to create the VPC Endpoint for the preceding mapping in at least one of `us-east-1e`, `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`.

:::{note}
This limitation does not apply to [cross-region PrivateLink connections](#ec-aws-inter-region-private-link). If you're creating a cross-region connection, then you don't need to check that your VPC is present in all availability zones.
:::

### Create your VPC endpoint and DNS entries in AWS [ec-aws-vpc-dns]

1. Create a VPC endpoint in your VPC using the service name for your region.

    Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) for additional details on creating a VPC interface endpoint to an endpoint service.

    Select **PrivateLink Ready partner services** as the endpoint type. Use [the service name for your region](#ec-private-link-service-names-aliases) as the **Service name**.

    :::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-service.png
    :alt: PrivateLink
    :screenshot:
    :::

    The security group for the endpoint should, at minimum, allow for inbound connectivity from your instances' CIDR range on ports 443 and 9243. Security groups for the instances should allow for outbound connectivity to the endpoint on ports 443 and 9243.
    
    <!--need to verify this for serverless-->

    :::{tip}
    You can also create a cross-region endpoint. Refer to [Setting up an cross-region Private Link connection](#ec-aws-inter-region-private-link).
    :::

2. Create a DNS record.

    1. Create a Private hosted zone. 

        For {{ech}}, refer to the **Private hosted zone domain name** column in the [PrivateLink service names and aliases](#ec-private-link-service-names-aliases) table for the name of the zone.
        
        For {{serverless-full}}, to view the service metadata for your selected region, start to [create a new private connection policy](#ec-add-vpc-elastic) for the region and find the **Domain name** in the **Service metadata** dropdown.
        
        For example, for {{ech}} deployments in `us-east-1`, use `vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com` as the zone domain name. For {{serverless-full}} deployments in the same region, use `private.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud`.
        
        Don’t forget to associate the zone with your VPC.

        :::{tip}
        Private hosted zone domain names differ between {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, even if the region is the same.
        :::

        :alt: Private hosted zone example
        :screenshot:
        :::

    2. Create a DNS CNAME alias pointing to the PrivateLink endpoint. Add the record to a private DNS zone in your VPC. Use `*` as the record name, and the VPC endpoint DNS name as a value.

        Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) for details on creating a CNAME record which points to your VPC endpoint DNS name.

        :alt: PrivateLink CNAME
        :screenshot:
        :::

### Test the connection

After you create your VPC endpoint and DNS entries, check that you are able to reach your deployment or project over PrivateLink.

:::{include} _snippets/private-url-struct.md
:::

:::{tip}
Private hosted zone domain names differ between {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, even if the region is the same.
:::

To test the connection:

1. If needed, find the endpoint of an application in your deployment or project:

    }
    ```
    :::
    ::::

The connection is established, and a valid certificate is presented to the client. Elastic responds, in the case of the {{es}} endpoint, with basic information about the cluster.

## Optional: Create a private connection policy [ec-add-vpc-elastic]

After you test your PrivateLink connection, you can create a private connection policy in {{ecloud}}. 

Private connection policies are optional for AWS PrivateLink. After the VPC endpoint and DNS record are created, private connectivity is established.

Creating a private connection policy and associating it with your deployments or projects allows you to filter traffic to your deployments or projects using VPC filters.

Follow these high-level steps to add a private connection policy that can be associated with your deployments or projects.

1. Optional: [Find your VPC endpoint ID](#ec-find-your-endpoint).
2. [Create a private connection policy using the VPC endpoint](#create-private-connection-policy).
3. [Associate the VPC endpoint with your deployment or project](#associate-private-connection-policy).

### Optional: Find your VPC endpoint ID [ec-find-your-endpoint]

The VPC endpoint ID is only required if you want to filter traffic to your deployment or project using VPC filters.

You can find your VPC endpoint ID in the AWS console:

5. Select the resource type that the private connection will be applied to.
6.  Select the cloud provider and region for the private connection. 
   
    :::{tip}
    Private connection policies are bound to a single resource type and region, and can be assigned only to resources with the same resource type and in the same region. If you want to associate a policy with multiple resource types or resources in multiple regions, then you have to recreate the policy for all applicable resource types and regions.
    :::
7.  Under **Connectivity**, select **Privatelink**.
8.  Optional: Under **VPC filter**, enter your VPC endpoint ID. You should only specify a VPC filter if you want to filter traffic to your deployment or project. 
    
    If you don't specify a VPC filter, then the private connection policy acts only as a record that you've established private connectivity between AWS and Elastic in the applicable region.
    
    :::{tip}
    You can apply multiple policies to a single deployment or project. The policies can be of different types. In case of multiple policies, traffic can match any associated policy to be forwarded to the resource. If none of the policies match, the request is rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

    [Learn more about how network security policies affect your deployment or project](network-security-policies.md).
    :::

9.  Optional: Under **Apply to resources**, associate the new private connection policy with one or more deployments or projects. If you specified a VPC filter, then after you associate the filter with a resource, it starts filtering traffic.
    
    :::{note}
    Serverless projects require the Serverless Plus add-on to apply private connection policies. During the promotional period, applying a private connection policy to a project opts that project in to Serverless Plus.
    :::
10. To automatically attach this private connection policy to new resources of this type, select **Apply by default**.
11.  Click **Create**.
12. (Optional) If you created a private connection policy for {{ech}} deployments, you can [claim your VPC endpoint ID](/deploy-manage/security/claim-private-connection-api.md), so that no other organization is able to use it in a private connection policy.

The next step is to [associate the policy](#associate-private-connection-policy) with your deployment or project.

### Optional: Associate a private connection policy with a deployment or project[associate-private-connection-policy]

You can associate a private connection policy with your deployment or project from the policy's settings, or from your deployment's or project's settings. 

Serverless projects require the Serverless Plus add-on to apply private connection policies. During the promotional period, applying a private connection policy to a project opts that project in to Serverless Plus.

## Access the resource over a PrivateLink [ec-access-the-deployment-over-private-link]

For traffic to connect with the deployment or project over AWS PrivateLink, the client making the request needs to be located within the VPC where you’ve created the VPC endpoint. You can also set up network traffic to flow through the originating VPC from somewhere else, such as another VPC or VPN from your corporate network. This assumes that the VPC endpoint and the DNS record are also available within that context. Check your service provider documentation for setup instructions.

::::{important}
Use the alias you’ve set up as CNAME DNS record to access your resource.

    :::: {applies-item} ess: ga
    :::{include} _snippets/find-endpoint.md
    :::
    ::::
    :::: {applies-item} serverless: ga
    :::{include} _snippets/find-endpoint-serverless.md
    :::
    ::::
    :::::

2. Send a request:

    ::::{applies-switch}
    :::{applies-item} ess: ga
    **Request**

    ```sh

### AWS PrivateLink and Fleet

## Setting up a cross-region PrivateLink connection [ec-aws-inter-region-private-link]

AWS supports cross-region PrivateLink as described on the [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-cross-region-connectivity-for-aws-privatelink/).

This means your deployment or project on {{ecloud}} can be in a different region than the PrivateLink endpoints or the clients that consume the deployment or project endpoints.

In this example, `region 1` contains your VPC endpoint and `region 2` is the region where your deployment or project is hosted.

1. Begin to create your VPC endpoint in `region 1`, as described in [Create your VPC endpoint and DNS entries in AWS](#ec-aws-vpc-dns). In the service settings, do the following:

    * In the **Service name** field, enter the [VPC service name](#ec-private-link-service-names-aliases) for `region 2`.
    * Select **Enable Cross Region endpoint** and select `region 2` from the **Select a region** drop-down list.

1. [Create a private connection policy](#create-private-connection-policy) in the region where your deployment or project is hosted (`region 2`), and [associate it](#associate-private-connection-policy) with your deployment or project.
   
2. [Test the connection](#ec-access-the-deployment-over-private-link) from a VM or client in `region 1` to your Private Link endpoint, and it should be able to connect to your {{es}} deployment or project hosted in `region 2`.

## Manage private connection policies

After you create your private connection policy, you can edit it, remove it from your deployment or project, or delete it.

### Edit a private connection policy [edit-private-connection-policy]

You can edit a policy's name, description, VPC endpoint ID, and more.

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
1. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Edit** {icon}`pencil` button.
2. Click **Update** to save your changes.

:::{tip}
You can also edit private connection policies from your deployment or project's **Security** page or your project's **Network security** page.
:::

### Remove a private connection policy from your deployment or project [remove-private-connection-policy]

If you want to remove a specific policy from a deployment or project, or delete the policy, then you need to disconnect it from any associated deployments or projects first. You can do this from the policy's settings, or from your deployment or project's settings. To remove an association through the UI:

#### From your deployment or project

::::{applies-switch}
:::{applies-item} ess: ga
1. Find your deployment on the home page or on the **Hosted deployments** page, then select **Manage** to access its settings menus.

    On the **Hosted deployments** page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.
2. On the **Security** page, under **Network security**, find the policy that you want to disconnect. 
3. Under **Actions**, click the **Delete** icon.
:::
:::{applies-item} serverless: ga
1. Find your project on the home page or on the **Serverless projects** page, then select **Manage** to access its settings menus.
   
   On the **Serverless projects** page, you can narrow your projects by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.
2. On the **Security** page, under **Network security**, find the policy that you want to disconnect. 
3. Under **Actions**, click the **Delete** icon.
:::
::::

#### From the private connection policy settings

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
5. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Edit** {icon}`pencil` button.
6. Under **Apply to resources**, click the `x` beside the resource that you want to disconnect.
7. Click **Update** to save your changes.


### Delete a private connection policy [delete-private-connection-policy]

If you need to remove a policy, you must first remove any associations with deployments or projects.

To delete a policy:

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
4. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Delete** icon. The icon is inactive if there are deployments or projects associated with the policy.
