# Private connectivity

Private connectivity is a secure way for your {{ecloud}} deployments and projects to communicate with other cloud provider services over your cloud provider's private network. You can create a virtual private connection (VPC) using your provider's private link service, and then manage it in {{ecloud}} using a private connection policy. You can also optionally filter traffic to your deployments and projects by creating ingress filters for your VPC in {{ecloud}}.

Serverless projects require the Serverless Plus add-on to apply private connection policies. During the promotional period, applying a private connection policy to a project opts that project in to Serverless Plus.

:::{tip}
Private connection policies are a type of [network security policy](/deploy-manage/security/network-security-policies.md).
:::

Choose the relevant option for your cloud service provider:

| Cloud service provider | Service | Applicable deployment types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS | [AWS PrivateLink](/deploy-manage/security/private-connectivity-aws.md) | {{ech}}, {{serverless-short}} |
| Azure | [Azure Private Link](/deploy-manage/security/private-connectivity-azure.md) | {{ech}} |
| GCP | [GCP Private Service Connect](/deploy-manage/security/private-connectivity-gcp.md) | {{ech}} |

For private connections created for {{ech}} deployments, after you set up your private connection, you can [claim ownership of your private connection ID](/deploy-manage/security/claim-private-connection-api.md) to prevent other organizations from using it.

To learn how private connection policies work, how they affect your deployment or project, and how they interact with [IP filter policies](ip-filtering-cloud.md), refer to [](/deploy-manage/security/network-security-policies.md).

:::{tip}
{{ech}} and {{serverless-full}} also support [IP filters](/deploy-manage/security/ip-filtering-cloud.md). You can apply both IP filters and private connections to a single {{ecloud}} resource.

:::{note}
Private connection policies were formerly referred to as PrivateLink traffic filters.
