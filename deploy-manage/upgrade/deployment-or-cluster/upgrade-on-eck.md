# Upgrade your deployment on {{eck}} (ECK)

The ECK orchestrator can safely perform upgrades to newer versions of the {{stack}}.

Before you start the upgrade, [plan your upgrade](/deploy-manage/upgrade/plan-upgrade.md), [take the upgrade preparation steps](/deploy-manage/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade.md), and ensure your ECK version is [compatible](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s.md#stack-compatibility) with the {{stack}} version you’re upgrading to. If it's incompatible, [upgrade your orchestrator](/deploy-manage/upgrade/orchestrator/upgrade-cloud-on-k8s.md) first.

## How ECK manages upgrades

ECK ensures that {{stack}} components are upgraded in the correct order. Upgrades to dependent resources are delayed until that dependency is upgraded. For example, the {{kib}} upgrade starts only when the associated {{es}} cluster has been upgraded.

Check out [Nodes orchestration](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/nodes-orchestration.md) for more information on how ECK manages upgrades and how to tune its behavior.

## Perform the upgrade

The upgrade procedure depends on whether you are deploying the {{stack}} components [using resource manifests](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md) or the [{{stack}} Helm chart](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/managing-deployments-using-helm-chart.md).

### Upgrade using resource manifests

1. In the resource spec file, modify the `version` field for the desired {{stack}} version.
2. Save your changes. The orchestrator will start the upgrade process automatically.

In this example, we're upgrading {{es}} and {{kib}} to {{version.stack}} by changing the `spec.version` field in each component.

::::{dropdown} Example manifest
:::{important}
For production use, for {{stack}} version 8.16 and later, set the `vm.max_map_count` kernel setting to `1048576`; for {{stack}} version 8.15 and earlier, set `vm.max_map_count` to `262144`. Refer to [Virtual memory](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/virtual-memory.md) for more information.

### Upgrade using Helm charts

If you deploy your {{stack}} resources using our Helm chart, refer to [managing deployments using Helm chart](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/managing-deployments-using-helm-chart.md#k8s-upgrade-modify-helm) for details on how to perform upgrades with Helm.

## Next steps

Once you've successfully upgraded your deployment, you can [upgrade your ingest components](/deploy-manage/upgrade/ingest-components.md), such as {{ls}}, {{agents}}, or {{beats}}.
