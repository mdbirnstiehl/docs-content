# Troubleshoot IPv6 integration for {{ece}} on {{aws}}

This document provides troubleshooting guidance and verification commands for IPv6 integration with {{ece}} on {{aws}}, including ingress through load balancers and optional container egress.

For setup and architecture details, refer to [Setting up IPv6 for ECE on {{aws}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/ece-ipv6-aws-setup.md).

## Scope and expected outcomes

Use this page to troubleshoot the following traffic flows:

- **IPv6 ingress for deployment traffic**: Clients to deployments through {{aws}} Network Load Balancer (NLB) and ECE proxies.
- **IPv6 ingress for Cloud UI traffic**: Clients to Cloud UI endpoints through {{aws}} Application Load Balancer (ALB).
- **IPv6 egress**: Outbound IPv6 from containers.

Success criteria:

- Ingress: dual-stack client requests over IPv4 and IPv6 reach ECE, and client metadata is preserved through Proxy Protocol v2.
- Egress: containers can resolve and reach IPv6 endpoints.

## Diagnostic commands

Use the following commands to inspect the state of your ECE proxies, container networking, and connectivity across the IPv6 ingress and egress paths.

### Check ECE proxy logs for client IPs and errors

Run these commands on each host with the proxy role to verify that Proxy Protocol v2 is active and that client IPs are being preserved:

```bash
# List running containers to find the proxy container (look for "frc-proxies-proxyv2")
sudo podman ps

# View recent proxy request logs
# Look for the "client_ip" field to verify client IP preservation
sudo podman exec frc-proxies-proxyv2 tail -50 /app/logs/proxy.requests.log

# View proxy error logs
sudo podman exec frc-proxies-proxyv2 tail -50 /app/logs/proxy.requests.error.log

# Check proxy protocol configuration
sudo podman exec frc-proxies-proxyv2 grep -A5 proxy_protocol /elastic_cloud_apps/proxyv2/proxy.yaml

# Verify proxy protocol environment variables
sudo podman exec frc-proxies-proxyv2 env | grep -i proxy_proto
```

What to look for:

- `proxy.requests.log` shows external client addresses in `client_ip`.
- Proxy configuration includes Proxy Protocol v2 settings.
- `proxy.requests.error.log` does not show repeated protocol or upstream connection failures.

### Check container networking

If you configured IPv6 egress on Podman-based hosts, verify that the dual-stack network is in place and that containers are attached to it:

```bash
# List podman networks
sudo podman network ls

# Inspect the dual-stack network
sudo podman network inspect ece-network

# Check which network a container is using
sudo podman inspect <container_id> --format '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks}}'
```

:::{note}
This verification applies to Podman-based hosts only. On Docker-based hosts, IPv6 egress is configured through the default bridge in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, so the `ece-network` network and these commands do not apply.
:::

What to look for:

- The `ece-network` definition includes both IPv4 and IPv6 ranges.
- Containers that need outbound IPv6 are attached to `ece-network`.

### Test ingress connectivity

Confirm that the NLB and ALB accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections:

```bash
# Test NLB connectivity
curl -4 -k -v "https://<nlb-dns-name>/_health"
curl -6 -k -v "https://<nlb-dns-name>/_health"

# Test ALB connectivity (if configured)
curl -4 -k -v "https://<alb-dns-name>/"
curl -6 -k -v "https://<alb-dns-name>/"
```

What to look for:

- NLB commands return `200`. ALB commands return `200` or `302` (redirect to login).

:::{note}
The `curl -6` commands must be run from a machine with IPv6 connectivity. Running them from an IPv4-only host will fail regardless of the load balancer configuration.
:::

### Test egress connectivity

Verify that the host and containers can reach IPv6 endpoints:

```bash
# Test IPv6 from host
ping6 -c 3 ipv6.google.com

# Test IPv6 from inside a container
sudo podman exec <container_id> curl -6 -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://ipv6.google.com
```

What to look for:

- `ping6` succeeds from the host.
- Container `curl -6` reaches external endpoints successfully.

## Identify ECE vs {{aws}} issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to check |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Connection hangs before reaching ECE | {{aws}}: Security group, NLB config, or routing | {{aws}} Console: NLB target health, security groups, route tables |
| Connection reaches ECE but returns error | ECE: Proxy configuration or deployment issue | ECE proxy logs (`proxy.requests.error.log`) |
| Client IP shows as internal IP (for example `10.89.0.1`) | {{aws}}: Proxy Protocol not enabled on target group | {{aws}} Console: Target group attributes |
| IPv6 works but IPv4 does not, or IPv4 works but IPv6 does not | {{aws}}: NLB not dual-stack, or missing security group rules | {{aws}} Console: NLB IP address type, security group rules |
| Container cannot reach IPv6 endpoints | ECE: Container not on dual-stack network | Check container network with `podman inspect` |

## Proxy NLB issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Health checks failing | Ensure `--proxy-protocol-lenient` was used during ECE install.|
| Client IPs not preserved | Verify Proxy Protocol v2 is enabled on the target group. Check proxy logs show external IPs for `request_source: external`. |
| IPv6 connections failing | Check NLB has `IpAddressType: dualstack`, security groups allow `::/0`, and route tables have IPv6 routes to IGW. |
| Connection timeouts | Verify the proxies are healthy, and check security group rules for ports 443 and 9243. The NLB needs a subnet in each AZ that has an ECE proxy. |
| NLB using wrong security group | Ensure NLB uses a security group allowing inbound 443 (not the default VPC security group). |

## Cloud UI ALB issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Health checks failing | Verify the Cloud UI is running (`sudo podman ps \| grep admin`). Health check needs HTTPS, path `/`, success codes `200-399`. |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Security group must allow ALB to reach port 12443 on the instance. |
| Certificate errors | Ensure ACM certificate matches your domain. |
| IPv6 connections failing | Check ALB has `IpAddressType: dualstack` and security groups allow 443 from `::/0`. |
| At least two subnets error | ALBs require subnets in at least two availability zones. Create a second subnet in a different AZ. |

## IPv6 egress issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Network unreachable from container | Container not on dual-stack network. Verify `ece-network` exists with IPv6 and is set as default. Containers might need recreation. |
| IPv6 works on host but not in container | Check container network: `sudo podman inspect <container> --format '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks}}'`. Should show `ece-network`. |
| DNS resolution fails | Ensure container can resolve AAAA records. If using the [Netavark](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html) backend, ensure `aardvark-dns` is installed. |

## Diagnostics collection

When troubleshooting IPv6 issues, the [ECE diagnostic bundle (`ecediag`)](/troubleshoot/deployments/cloud-enterprise/run-ece-diagnostics-tool.md) collects proxy logs that include client IP information. Relevant files in the diagnostic bundle:

- `proxy.requests.log` - Contains `client_ip` field showing preserved client IPs
- `proxy.requests.error.log` - Contains failed requests with error reasons
- `proxy.yaml` - Proxy configuration including Proxy Protocol settings

For {{aws}}-side diagnostics (NLB/ALB health, security groups, route tables), use {{aws}} Console or CLI tools. These are not collected by ECE diagnostics.
